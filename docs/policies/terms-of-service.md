# **Dither Terms and Conditions**

**Effective Date:** September 25, 2025

1. **Acceptance of Terms**

These Terms and Conditions (the “Terms”) are a binding legal agreement between you (referred to as “you” or “User”) and All in Bits, Inc. (the company that operates Dither, referred to as “All in Bits,” “the Company,” “we,” or “us”). By accessing or using Dither, you confirm that you are at least 18 years old and agree to be bound by these Terms and all applicable laws and regulations. If you do not agree with these Terms, you must not use Dither. Please read these Terms carefully, as they contain important information about your rights, obligations, and restrictions (including provisions regarding acceptable use of the service, content ownership, warranty disclaimers, limitation of liability, and requirements to resolve disputes through arbitration). These Terms incorporate by reference any additional guidelines, policies, or rules provided on the Dither website or application (including our Privacy Policy).

2. **Eligibility and Account Requirements**  
* **Minimum Age:** You must be at least 18 years old (or the age of majority in your jurisdiction, if higher) to use Dither. By using the platform, you represent and warrant that you meet this age requirement and have the legal capacity to enter into this agreement.  
    
* **Wallet Authentication:** To post content or interact on Dither, you are required to connect a supported cryptocurrency wallet. Account creation on Dither does not involve traditional usernames or passwords; instead, your blockchain wallet serves as your identity and login mechanism. You are responsible for maintaining the security of your wallet’s private keys and credentials. Do not share your private keys with anyone. We will never ask you for your private key, and you should never provide it to any third party claiming to represent Dither. All in Bits has no access to or control over your wallet or its keys, and we cannot recover your wallet or posts if you lose access to it. Any actions taken through your wallet (such as posting content or executing transactions) will be deemed to be authorized by you. If you discover any unauthorized use of your wallet or suspect that your security has been compromised, you should discontinue using Dither and notify us immediately.  
    
* **No Personal Data Collection:** Except for your public wallet address and information you choose to share on the platform, Dither does not require you to provide personal identifying information. We do not collect full names, emails, or other personal data as a condition of use. Please note, however, that content you post might contain personal information if you include it, and such content will become public on the blockchain. *Refer to our Privacy Policy for details on data practices.*   
    
* **Compliance and Eligibility:** By using Dither, you also represent that you are not prohibited from using the service under applicable laws (for example, you are not on any trade sanctions or prohibited persons lists), and that you will comply with all relevant laws and regulations while using Dither. We reserve the right to refuse access to Dither, or to suspend/terminate any user’s access, if we determine you have violated these Terms or if we are required to do so by law.

3. **Decentralized Platform Features and User Content**

Dither is a decentralized social media platform that operates on a public blockchain. As such, its core features and behaviors may differ from traditional social networks. By using Dither, you understand and agree to the following characteristics of the platform:

* **Public, Permanent Ledger:** When you publish a post or any content on Dither, it is recorded on the AtomOne blockchain (using ChronoState event-sourcing technology) as part of a permanent, public ledger. This means that all posts are public and permanent: they are visible to anyone with access to the blockchain and cannot be easily edited or deleted once submitted. All in Bits does not have the ability to retroactively erase or modify content stored on the blockchain, since the network is decentralized and uncensorable by design. Think carefully before you post any content, because it will become a lasting part of the public record.

* **User Content Is Not Ours:** Posts are authored by users. We do not control, endorse, or assume responsibility for user content, and we make no warranties regarding its accuracy, quality, legality, or safety. Your interactions with other users are solely between you and them.

* **Chronological Feed (No Algorithmic Ranking):** Content on Dither is displayed in strict chronological order, from newest to oldest. We do not use any algorithmic ranking or personalized feed sorting to prioritize certain posts over others.

* **Immutable and Convergent Content:** Because of the blockchain-backed design, the “state” of Dither (all the posts and interactions) can be reproduced by any client that reads the blockchain data. This means third-party applications can also display Dither content by accessing the same public data. You acknowledge that multiple interfaces or apps may access and present Dither posts, and All in Bits does not exclusively control how content is displayed across all platforms. (For example, an independent developer could create their own app or website to read Dither’s blockchain data and show posts in their own style or with additional features.)

* **No Guarantee of Removal:** Given the permanent, decentralized nature of Dither, removal of content (even if it violates these Terms) may not be absolute. While the Company or certain interface providers might block or hide content from view on specific applications, the data may still exist on the underlying blockchain or on other interfaces outside of our control. In using Dither, you accept that content you encounter is user-generated and not pre-screened by us, and you may be exposed to material that is offensive, inaccurate, or otherwise objectionable. We are not responsible for content that appears on the blockchain, but we do expect all users to adhere to the community guidelines below to foster a healthy environment.

* **AI training.** We do not use your posts to train generative AI systems. If that changes, we will update these Terms and provide notice.

By posting content on Dither, you affirm that you have the rights to any material you upload (e.g., you wrote the text, or have permission to post it), and you understand that this content will be broadly and permanently disseminated. You retain ownership of the intellectual property in content you create, but you grant All in Bits and other Dither users a license to store, transmit, display, and reproduce your content as necessary for operating the platform. This license is worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, and sublicensable (for example, it allows other users to view your posts and allows third-party services to retrieve and display them). Because the content is published on a public blockchain, you also effectively allow the public at large to access and read your posts. Do not post any content on Dither that you wish to keep private or that you do not have the legal right to share in a public, permanent manner.

4. **Community Guidelines and Prohibited Content**

Dither is founded on principles of free expression and community self-moderation. We believe in giving users control over their social experience without centralized curation. However, freedom comes with responsibility: to keep Dither a welcoming and lawful space, we have community guidelines that all users must follow. By contributing content to Dither or interacting with others, you agree to abide by these guidelines and not engage in prohibited conduct. In general, use common sense and be respectful. You are expected to moderate your own behavior conscientiously and help maintain a healthy community. If you violate these rules, you risk community backlash and potential action on our part (including suspension or banning of your wallet from posting, as described later). Prohibited content or activities on Dither include, but are not limited to, the following:

* **Illegal Material or Activities:** Do not use Dither for any unlawful purposes or to post any content that is illegal under applicable laws. This includes (but is not limited to) content related to child sexual exploitation, human trafficking, illicit drug sales, explicit incitement of violence or criminal activity, or any material that would violate laws or regulations if distributed. You also may not use Dither in violation of export control or sanctions laws (for example, by providing services to users in prohibited regions).

* **Harassment and Hate:** Dither prohibits content that harasses, bullies, or threatens others. You may not post anything that promotes violence or hatred against individuals or groups based on characteristics such as race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sex, gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, or medical condition. Personal attacks, stalking, and encouragement of self-harm or suicide are also forbidden. We strive for a community where users feel safe and respected; engaging in persistent harassment or hate speech will not be tolerated.

* **Doxing and Privacy Violations:** Do not post other people’s personal or sensitive information without consent. This includes personal data such as someone’s full name, home address, telephone number, email address, Social Security or other government ID numbers, financial information, or any information that is not publicly available and could violate someone’s privacy. Publishing private communications of someone without permission is strictly prohibited. Respect others’ privacy just as you would want yours to be respected.

* **Malicious Software and Fraud:** You may not upload or link to viruses, malware, spyware, phishing schemes, or any other content that is designed to harm or exploit others’ devices or accounts. Additionally, attempts to scam or defraud users (for example, posting fraudulent investment schemes, impersonating someone in an attempt to steal assets, or directing users to malicious websites) are forbidden. Do not use Dither to engage in any form of phishing, pyramid schemes, or multi-level marketing solicitations.

* **Automated Access / Scraping Controls:** You may not bypass or defeat rate limits, engage in bulk scraping or automated posting outside documented APIs, or otherwise degrade or disrupt the Service. We may block abusive IPs, clients, or keys.

* **Coordinated Disinformation:** While Dither does not employ algorithmic censorship, we do not allow coordinated disinformation campaigns on the platform. In other words, you may not use Dither to deliberately spread false or misleading information at scale, especially if done in an organized or automated fashion to deceive the community or manipulate public opinion. This includes creating bots or multiple accounts working together to amplify propaganda or fake news. Our community values truthful, authentic dialogue, and maliciously undermining that with disinformation is against these Terms. This guideline is not intended to police ordinary sharing of opinions or unintentional misinformation by individuals; it targets deliberate, coordinated attempts to deceive.

* **Intellectual Property Infringement:** Only post content that you have rights to post. Do not share content that violates the copyright, trademark, or other intellectual property rights of others. For example, do not upload someone else’s artwork, music, or text without permission, and do not use Dither to distribute pirated material. If you incorporate any third-party content in your posts, you must have the legal right to do so (such as a license or fair use rationale). If you repeatedly infringe on others’ intellectual property rights, we may suspend or terminate your access, and infringing content may be removed in accordance with our Copyright policy (see “DMCA” below).

* **Spam and Network Abuse:** You may not use Dither to spam or to engage in activity that could degrade the experience of others. This includes posting repetitive or irrelevant content in a way that overwhelms the platform, using scripts or automation to post or message at a rapid rate, or attempting to “trend” content by gaming the system. Also, do not attempt to overload, flood, or strain the Dither network or the underlying blockchain with unreasonable data or requests. Such behaviors can threaten platform stability and are not allowed.

* **Illegal Content; Mandatory Reporting (CSAM/NCMEC):** We strictly prohibit child sexual exploitation material (CSAM) and related offenses. If we become aware of suspected CSAM, we will report to the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children (NCMEC) and preserve and disclose information as required by 18 U.S.C. §2258A and other applicable laws.

This list of prohibited conduct is not exhaustive. All in Bits reserves the right to determine, in its reasonable discretion, whether any content or behavior is objectionable or violates the spirit of these guidelines, and to take appropriate action as described below.

5. **Moderation and Enforcement**

**No Duty to Monitor; Good‑Faith Moderation:** We are not obligated to screen, monitor, review, or edit user content. We may, however, in our sole discretion and in good faith, remove, refuse to display, label, filter, limit visibility of, or disable access to any content on interfaces we control, at any time and for any reason (including to comply with law, enforce these Terms, or reduce potential liability), without affecting the underlying blockchain record. 

**Community-Driven Moderation:** Dither’s moderation model is primarily *conscience-driven and community-led.* This means we encourage users to self-moderate and to use the tools provided (such as content filters, muting or blocking users, and community flagging mechanisms) to curate their own experience. Unlike traditional social media, there is no algorithmic content removal or ranking done behind the scenes by the Company. Instead, visibility of content is organic, every post is out there on the blockchain, and you choose whom to follow or what content to see, possibly with help from community-provided filters.

**Interface Providers and Community Filters:** Because Dither content is open and accessible, various “interface providers” (including the official Dither app/website and third-party apps) may offer their own moderation features. For example, a particular Dither interface might allow users to mark posts as sensitive or hide posts that the community has broadly flagged for containing certain types of content. Interface providers may filter or flag content based on community input or their own policies, to help users navigate content (e.g., hiding posts tagged as pornographic or clearly offensive), but importantly, these measures do not remove the content from the blockchain itself. They only affect how content is presented in that specific application. All in Bits is not responsible for moderation decisions made by independent third-party interfaces, which may have their own terms of service and community standards. We encourage all interface providers to honor Dither’s community guidelines, but ultimately each provider might implement filters differently.

**No Centralized Censorship (With Limited Exceptions):** All in Bits will not routinely pre-screen or remove user content from the AtomOne blockchain, nor do we dictate what should be visible beyond providing the above guidelines. We believe in censorship-resistance and user empowerment. We do not actively moderate on-chain messages for legality or accuracy (we technically can’t), but users must abide by the law and refrain from posting prohibited material. This means any opinions, information, or materials you share are your sole responsibility. All In Bits (Dither’s parent company) disclaims liability for content posted by users to the extent allowed by law. However, we do not permit illegal content and will comply with lawful orders. We reserve the right to intervene and enforce these Terms when necessary. In particular, if we become aware of content that flagrantly violates these Terms or the law (for example, illegal content such as child exploitation material, credible threats of violence, or similarly extreme situations), we may act to remove, block, or restrict that content on any official Dither interfaces we control, and/or prevent the offending user (wallet address) from further participation on those interfaces. We may also refer matters to law enforcement when appropriate. Such actions are taken at our sole discretion and may occur with or without prior notice to the user, especially if urgent. It’s important to understand that even if we block content on our own interface or ban a user’s wallet from posting via our service, the content might still exist on the underlying blockchain or be accessible through other means. Our actions are limited to what we control (for instance, the Dither web application or any nodes we operate). We cannot guarantee the complete elimination of any content from the decentralized network.

**Reporting Problems:** If you encounter content or behavior that you believe violates these Terms or is otherwise harmful, we encourage you to report it to us (if using an official Dither interface with a “Report” function), via email to legal@tendermint.com or to community moderators if available. We will review reports and determine the appropriate enforcement action. Please note that not all reported content will result in removal; we will balance enforcement with our commitment to open dialogue. False or malicious reporting of innocent content is itself a violation of these Terms.

**User Responsibility:** Remember, you are responsible for your own conduct and content on Dither. The community will often be the judge of what is acceptable through their reactions, and any content you post is tied to your wallet address and reputation. These Terms exist to set baseline rules and protect users, but they are also aligned with values of transparency and accountability. In summary, treat others with respect, abide by the law, and think before you post. If you violate these Terms, you may lose the privilege of using Dither’s official services, and your content may be filtered or labeled, but the consequences (social or legal) of what you publish are ultimately yours to bear.

**Independent Interfaces and Moderators:** Third‑party interfaces that read Dither’s on‑chain data, and community moderators who operate them, are independent of All in Bits and are not our agents. We are not responsible for decisions or policies adopted by independent interfaces or moderators.

**Imminent Harm:** Where we reasonably believe content or activity poses an imminent risk of serious harm, we may immediately restrict access to that content on interfaces we control, notify appropriate authorities, and take other proportionate steps.

**U.S. Legal Notice (47 U.S.C. §230):** To the extent U.S. law applies, we may in good faith restrict access to material we consider objectionable, and we are not liable for third‑party content posted by users.

**Notice and Appeal.** If you believe content available through an interface we operate is illegal, or that we have restricted your content in error, contact legal@tendermint.com with details sufficient to identify the content and your reason. We will review reasonable notices and appeals and, where appropriate on interfaces we control, act and reply in a timely manner. This process concerns interface‑level measures only and does not alter on‑chain records.

**Prompt Action on Reports.** For interfaces we control, we review reports about unlawful content and abusive behavior and take appropriate action in a timely manner, consistent with our policies and applicable app‑store rules.

6. **Ownership and Intellectual Property**

**Our Property:** All in Bits, Inc. (and its affiliates and licensors) owns all rights, title, and interest in and to the Dither platform, including the software, the design, functionality, and all trademarks, logos, and brand features associated with Dither. All in Bits also owns the compilation of content that is presented in the Dither interface (excluding individual user posts). These are protected by intellectual property laws. You may not copy, distribute, sell, lease, reverse engineer, or otherwise exploit any part of Dither’s software or services that are owned by us, except as permitted by law or with our express written permission. This includes our website’s look-and-feel, the Dither name and logo, and any content that All in Bits or our partners have provided (unless such content is expressly noted as open source or in the public domain). You also may not use All in Bits’ trademarks (including “Dither”) in a way that could cause confusion as to source or endorsement without our prior consent.

**Your Property:** You retain ownership of the content that you create and post on Dither. Posting content to Dither does not transfer ownership of any intellectual property rights you have in your content to us. However, by using Dither and posting content to the blockchain through our platform, you hereby grant us, and anyone accessing Dither, a license to use that content as needed to operate and provide the services. Specifically, you grant All in Bits a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, irrevocable license (with the right to sublicense to others, such as to users and third-party developers) to store, transmit, publish, display, and perform your content in connection with the Dither platform. This license is necessary because, for example, we need to transmit your posts to other users’ devices, display them on various interfaces, and archive them as part of the blockchain’s permanent ledger. This license continues indefinitely with respect to content recorded on the blockchain (since we cannot undo the posting), but it will cease with respect to All in Bits specifically if we delete the content from any services under our control. Even if All in Bits’ license ends, the content itself may persist on the blockchain or in decentralized storage, and other users or nodes may continue to have access to it under the decentralized network’s rules.

By submitting content, you also agree that you have all necessary rights to that content and that no content you post will infringe or violate the rights of any third party (including intellectual property rights, privacy rights, or contractual rights). You are solely responsible for the content you post. If your content includes any third-party material (for example, excerpts of text, images, or videos you did not create), it is your responsibility to ensure you have permission or a legal basis to include it. All in Bits does not pre-approve content, and we do not assume liability for user posts; however, if we are notified of infringing content, we will respond as described below.

**Feedback:** If you choose to provide us with feedback or suggestions about Dither (for example, ideas to improve features or reports of bugs), you acknowledge that we may use or implement those suggestions without any compensation or obligation to you. Any feedback you provide is entirely voluntary, and we will be free to use it as we see fit and without restriction.

7. **Copyright Infringement Policy (DMCA Notice)**

All in Bits respects intellectual property rights and expects users to do the same. Although content on Dither is stored on a blockchain, we are committed to complying with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (“DMCA”) and other applicable copyright laws. If you believe that any content on Dither infringes your copyright (for example, someone has posted your copyrighted work without permission), you or your agent may send us a DMCA Notice of Alleged Infringement. Upon our receipt of a valid DMCA notice, we will review the claim and take appropriate action, which may include removing or disabling access to the allegedly infringing content on any Dither interface we control and/or notifying the user who posted it. Due to Dither’s decentralized design, removal from our interface does not guarantee complete removal from the blockchain, but we will make a good-faith effort to limit access via our services.

**Designated Copyright Agent:**  
In accordance with the DMCA, All in Bits has designated the following agent to receive notifications of claimed infringement. Please send DMCA notices to:  
Name of Agent: Carolyn Pehrson, ACP \#153281  
Address: 3395 South Jones Blvd. \#153, Las Vegas, NV 89146  
Telephone: 1-661-388-6953  
Email: legal@tendermint.com  
**Contents of Your DMCA Notice:** Your notification must be in writing (either electronic or paper communication) and include **all** of the following:

1. **Identification of the copyrighted work** you believe has been infringed. If multiple copyrighted works are covered by your notice (e.g., a list of images), you may provide a representative list.  
2. **Identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing** and that you request to be removed or disabled, including information reasonably sufficient to allow us to locate the material. Be as specific as possible, ideally including the URL or transaction hash or post ID on Dither where the material appears.  
3. **Your contact information** – including your full name, mailing address, telephone number, and email address, so we can reach you if needed.  
4. **A statement that you have a good-faith belief** that the disputed use of the material is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law (for example, “I believe in good faith that the use of the copyrighted material described above is not authorized by the owner, its agent, or the law”).  
5. **A statement that the information in your notice is accurate**, and under penalty of perjury, that you are the copyright owner or authorized to act on the copyright owner’s behalf.  
6. **Your electronic or physical signature.** If you are sending an email, you may type your full legal name as your signature. If you are sending a paper notice, you must sign it.

If your notice does not contain all of these elements, it may not be effective under the DMCA. Once we receive a compliant notice, we will act expeditiously to investigate and address the issue. We may forward the notice (with your contact information) to the user who posted the content, and/or publicly post the notice (with personal information redacted) to a database of takedown requests.

**Counter-Notification:** If you are a user who posted content that was removed due to a DMCA notice, and you believe the content was mistakenly removed (for example, as a result of misidentification or because you believe you have the right to post it), you may send us a counter-notification. A valid counter-notification should include your contact information, identification of the content removed, a statement under penalty of perjury that you have a good-faith belief the content was removed in error or misidentification, and your consent to the jurisdiction of the federal court in your district (or in Nevada, if you are outside the United States). Upon receiving a valid counter-notice, we may restore the content in question after at least 10 business days unless our designated agent first receives notice that the original complaining party has filed a court action seeking to restrain you from infringing the material. (Please consult legal counsel or see 17 U.S.C. §512(g) for the requirements of a proper DMCA counter-notification.)

All in Bits will, in appropriate circumstances, terminate users who are repeat infringers. Because Dither is tied to wallet addresses, this may involve banning the offending wallet address from interacting with our services. We also reserve the right to restrict access by any user who we believe is infringing intellectual property rights, at our discretion.

8. **Disclaimers of Warranty**

Dither is an experimental, cutting-edge platform, and we want to be upfront that your use of Dither is at your own risk. All in Bits provides the Dither service on an “AS IS” and “AS AVAILABLE” basis, without any warranties of any kind, either express or implied. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we disclaim all warranties and conditions, express or implied, regarding Dither and its content, including (but not limited to) implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, non-infringement, accuracy, and quiet enjoyment. We do not guarantee that the platform will meet your requirements or expectations, that it will be uninterrupted, secure, or error-free, or that any content (including user content) will be accurate or reliable.

**Specific Acknowledgments:** By using Dither, you acknowledge and agree to the following without limiting the generality of the above disclaimer:

* **Blockchain Risks:** Dither operates on a blockchain network, which means transactions (including posting content) are processed by a decentralized network of computers. All in Bits has no control over the blockchain transactions or fees required (such as gas fees). You understand that blockchain technology comes with inherent risks, including the possibility of software bugs, network failures, consensus failures, unexpected chain forks, or other technical issues that could affect the platform’s operation. You also understand that transactions on the blockchain are irreversible; if you accidentally post something or send a transaction with errors, we cannot undo it. All in Bits is not responsible for any losses or consequences arising from blockchain operational issues, such as delayed or failed transactions, smart contract vulnerabilities, or incompatibility with your device or wallet.

* **No Control Over User Behavior:** You understand that other users contribute content to Dither, and we do not approve content before it is published. We do not endorse, guarantee, or make any representations regarding any user-generated content on Dither. Content may be offensive, inaccurate, or misleading, and in some cases may be mislabeled or deceptively posted. All in Bits is not liable for any statements or conduct of any third parties on Dither. Use your judgment and be cautious about the content you read or the people you interact with on the platform.

* **Security and Software:** While we strive to maintain a secure service, we do not warrant that Dither will be secure or free from viruses, malware, or other harmful components. Downloading or obtaining any material through Dither is done at your own discretion and risk. You are solely responsible for any damage to your computer system, mobile device, or wallet, or loss of data that may result from any content or material obtained through the use of Dither. We encourage you to use up-to-date antivirus software and to take other appropriate precautions.

* **Feature Development:** Dither is a novel platform that may introduce new features or change existing ones over time as it evolves. Beta features or updates may be deployed which could have unforeseen issues. We make no guarantees regarding the availability or functionality of any specific feature. For example, a feature such as content filtering or upvote/downvote tracking might be modified, or new moderation tools might be added, in the future. We will try to communicate significant changes, but such changes may not come with prior notice. You accept the risk that the service may change and that any part of the service may be modified, suspended, or discontinued at any time without liability.

* **Third-Party Links and Services:** Content on Dither or user posts may contain links to third-party websites or services that are not owned or controlled by All in Bits. Additionally, as noted, third-party apps may interface with Dither’s data. We do not endorse or assume any responsibility for any such third-party sites, information, materials, products, or services. If you access any third-party website or service via Dither, you do so at your own risk, and you understand that these Terms and our policies do not apply to those external sites. Be aware when you leave Dither and read the terms and privacy policy of any third-party service you visit.  
* **No Delivery Guarantee**: Interface display and delivery are best‑effort. We do not guarantee that any post or action will be displayed, propagated, or delivered within any particular time.

**No Advice:** No information obtained through Dither constitutes professional, legal, financial or investment advice on our part. For example, even if Dither content may include discussions about cryptocurrency or tokens, All in Bits does not endorse or recommend any particular transactions. Always do your own research or consult professionals for advice as needed. You acknowledge that any decisions you make based on content on Dither are solely your own responsibility.

Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain warranties. To the extent that such laws apply to you, some of the exclusions above may not apply. In that case, our warranties are limited to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law.

9. **Limitation of Liability**

To the fullest extent permitted by law, neither All in Bits nor you (the user) will be liable to the other for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages whatsoever arising out of or related to your use of (or inability to use) Dither, or any content on Dither, even if advised of the possibility of such damages. This exclusion includes, without limitation, damages for lost profits, lost data, business interruption, reputation or goodwill loss, or the cost of procurement of substitute services or technology.

In addition, All in Bits’ total aggregate liability to you for all claims arising out of or relating to these Terms or the Dither service will not exceed the greater of: (a) One Hundred U.S. Dollars (US $100.00), or (b) the total amount you have paid to All in Bits for use of Dither in the twelve months prior to the claim (which, in most cases, will be $0, since Dither generally does not charge for basic usage). This limitation applies to any and all claims, whether based on warranty, contract, statute, tort (including negligence), or any other legal theory.

The limitations of liability in this section are a fundamental part of this agreement between you and All in Bits. All in Bits would not be able to offer Dither to you on an economically feasible basis without such limitations. If applicable law does not allow the limitation of liability for certain damages (for example, in some jurisdictions certain warranties or liabilities cannot be excluded or limited), then our liability will be limited to the maximum extent permitted by law. Nothing in these Terms is intended to exclude or limit any condition, warranty, right or liability which may not be lawfully excluded or limited.

10. **Indemnification**

You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless All in Bits, Inc., its parent, affiliates, and their respective officers, directors, employees, and agents (collectively, the “Indemnified Parties”), from and against any and all claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs) that arise from or relate to your use or misuse of Dither, your violation of these Terms, or your violation of any laws or rights of a third party. This includes, for example, claims related to content you posted (such as someone else claiming that your post infringed their rights or caused them harm).

All in Bits reserves the right, at our own expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise subject to indemnification by you (in which case you agree to cooperate with us in defending such matter and not to settle any such matter without our consent). You agree to promptly notify All in Bits of any third-party claims against you that could affect All in Bits, of which you become aware.  
This indemnity obligation will survive any termination of your use of Dither or these Terms.

**User Disputes; Release:** If you have a dispute with one or more users, you release All in Bits, Inc. (and our officers, directors, employees, contractors, and agents) from claims, demands, and damages of every kind and nature, known and unknown, arising out of or in any way connected with such disputes.

11. **Governing Law and Dispute Resolution**

Please read this section carefully, as it requires you to arbitrate disputes with All in Bits and limits the manner in which you can seek relief. This means you are waiving your right to a trial by jury and to participate in class actions, as explained below.

**Governing Law:** These Terms and any dispute or claim arising out of or related to these Terms or your use of Dither shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, USA, without regard to its conflict of law principles. However, if you reside outside the United States, you may have certain consumer protection rights under the laws of your country of residence that are in addition to or different from the protections under Delaware law; these Terms are not intended to deprive you of those protections to the extent they apply by law.

**Arbitration Agreement:** You and All in Bits agree that any dispute, claim, or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the Dither platform (including its interpretation or the breach, termination, or validity thereof), or the use of the Service, shall be resolved exclusively through final and binding arbitration, rather than in court, except as otherwise stated in the “Exceptions” subsection below. This arbitration agreement is governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. §§ 1 et seq.) and evidences a transaction in interstate commerce. This provision shall survive termination of the agreement.

**Arbitration Procedures:** The arbitration will be administered by JAMS (Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services) or a similar reputable arbitration body, under the JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules & Procedures, including any expedited procedures where applicable. The JAMS rules are available at the JAMS website (https://www.jamsadr.com). If JAMS is not available to arbitrate, the parties will select an alternative arbitral forum by mutual agreement. The arbitration will be conducted by a single, neutral arbitrator. The language of the arbitration shall be English. The seat or legal place of arbitration will be Wilmington, Delaware, USA, but (unless the parties agree otherwise) the arbitration may be conducted remotely via video conference or telephone to make it more convenient for both parties. Confidentiality: Both you and All in Bits agree that any arbitration proceedings (and any rulings, decisions or awards by the arbitrator) will be kept confidential, except as may be necessary to prepare for or conduct the arbitration, or to enforce the arbitration award in court.

**Arbitration and Legal Costs:** Each party will be responsible for its own attorneys’ fees and costs in arbitration, unless the arbitrator determines that a claim was frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (in which case the arbitrator may award attorneys’ fees to the prevailing party, to the extent permitted by law). The payment of JAMS fees and costs will be governed by the JAMS rules; however, if you are an individual consumer and not able to pay the filing fee, All in Bits will consider a request to pay or reimburse fees to ensure the arbitration proceeds.

**Class Action Waiver:** You and All in Bits each agree that any disputes will be resolved only on an individual basis, and not in a class, consolidated, or representative action. This means that you waive your right to participate in any class action lawsuit, class-wide arbitration, or other representative proceeding against us. The arbitrator may not consolidate or join the claims of other persons or parties who may be similarly situated, and shall not have authority to hear arbitration as a class action. If this class action waiver is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of the Arbitration Agreement (above) shall be null and void, but the remainder of the Terms will continue to apply.

**Jury Trial Waiver**: If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than through arbitration, you and All in Bits waive any right to a jury trial. You agree that if litigation does occur, any such proceeding (other than small claims, as noted in “Exceptions” below) shall be conducted exclusively in the state or federal courts located in Wilmington, Delaware, and you hereby consent to personal jurisdiction and venue in those courts. You further agree not to raise forum non conveniens or any similar objection, and that Delaware is an appropriate and convenient forum for resolving disputes.

**Exceptions to Arbitration:** Notwithstanding the above, both parties retain the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction (which for All in Bits means the state or federal courts in Delaware, unless another jurisdiction is required by law) to prevent actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of a party’s copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property rights. In addition, if you are an individual (i.e., not a business) using Dither for personal use, you have the right to opt out of this arbitration agreement within 30 days of first agreeing to these Terms by sending written notice of your decision to opt out to legal@tendermint.com, including your name and wallet address. If you opt out of arbitration, you agree that all disputes (subject to the class action waiver and jury waiver above) must be resolved exclusively in the courts specified above.

**30-Day Right to Opt Out:** As noted, if you are a new user of Dither, you may opt out of the Arbitration Agreement and Class Action Waiver within 30 days of accepting these Terms, by sending a written (email is acceptable) notice to us. The notice must clearly indicate your intent to opt out of arbitration. If you opt out, then notwithstanding the opt-out, these Terms will continue to apply to you, and the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the Delaware courts will govern any litigation that arises between you and All in Bits (with the jury trial waiver and class waiver still applicable). If you do not opt out within the 30-day period, you will be bound by the arbitration agreement and class action waiver as described above.

**Severability of Dispute Provisions:** If any portion of this Dispute Resolution section is found to be illegal or unenforceable (other than the class action waiver, which is addressed above), such provision shall be severed and the remainder of this section shall be given full effect.

12. **Changes to the Terms**

All in Bits may, from time to time, modify or update these Terms. We may do so for various reasons, such as to reflect changes in Dither’s features or functionality, to account for updates to laws or regulations, or to clarify our policies. We will notify users of material changes by posting the updated Terms on the Dither website or app and updating the “Effective Date” at the top, and/or by providing a notice through Dither or via email (if we have your contact information). It is your responsibility to review these Terms periodically. Updated Terms will be effective as of the time of posting (or a later date if specified in the update). By continuing to use Dither after any changes to the Terms take effect, you agree to the revised Terms. If you do not agree to the revised Terms, you must stop using Dither and, if applicable, disconnect your wallet from the platform.

For any minor or non-material changes (such as rephrasing or corrections), we may not provide advance notice, so it’s wise to check this document occasionally. For significant changes (like changes to the dispute resolution clause or new user obligations), we will aim to give advance notice when possible. Regardless, we encourage you to stay informed about our Terms to ensure you understand the conditions of using Dither.

13. **Miscellaneous Provisions**

**Entire Agreement:** These Terms (including any policies or guidelines incorporated by reference) constitute the entire agreement between you and All in Bits concerning your use of Dither, and supersede any prior agreements, proposals or communications (whether oral or written) relating to your use of the platform.

**No Waiver:** If we do not enforce any part of these Terms, it will not be considered a waiver of our rights or provisions of the Terms. Similarly, no waiver by us of any breach or default by you shall be deemed a waiver of any preceding or subsequent breach or default. All in Bits’ rights and remedies under these Terms remain cumulative and not exclusive of any other rights or remedies provided by law.

**Severability:** If any provision of these Terms is held by a court or arbitrator of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable, the parties nevertheless agree that the court/arbitrator should endeavor to give effect to the parties’ intentions as reflected in the provision, and the invalid or unenforceable provision will be modified to the minimum extent necessary to make it valid and enforceable, or if it cannot be made enforceable, then severed (removed) from these Terms. In either case, the remaining provisions of these Terms will continue in full force and effect.

**Assignment:** You may not assign or transfer these Terms (or any of your rights or obligations hereunder) without our prior written consent. Any attempted assignment by you in violation of this provision is null and void. All in Bits may freely assign or transfer these Terms to an affiliate or in connection with a merger, acquisition, corporate reorganization, or sale of all or substantially all of our assets.

**Relationship of Parties:** These Terms do not create any agency, partnership, joint venture, employment, or franchise relationship between you and All in Bits. You and we are independent contractors. You have no authority to bind us or to act on our behalf, and vice versa.

**Force Majeure:** All in Bits shall not be liable for any delay or failure to perform resulting from causes outside its reasonable control, such as natural disasters, acts of government, war, civil unrest, acts of terror, labor strikes, internet or power outages, or other force majeure events.

**Survival:** Provisions of these Terms which by their nature should survive termination (including, by way of example, disclaimers of warranty, limitation of liability, indemnification, and dispute resolution provisions) will survive any termination or expiration of these Terms and/or your use of Dither.

**Headings:** The section titles in these Terms are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect.

**Regional Compliance (EU/UK and Other Jurisdictions):** Where required by local law (for example, the EU Digital Services Act or the UK Online Safety Act), we may provide region‑specific notice‑and‑action mechanisms, appeals, or transparency reporting; appoint local points of contact; and limit features or access (including geo-blocking) to remain compliant.

**Transparency:** We may publish periodic transparency reports describing our moderation tools, policies, and aggregated enforcement metrics, and we may provide additional disclosures where required by law.
