        <span><strong>1. Operator and Scope</strong></span>
    </h2>
</doc-anchor-target>
<p>All In Bits, Inc., a Delaware corporation (referred to as the “operator,” “we,” or “us”), operates Dither and is the data controller for personal information processed through Dither. This Policy applies to the use of Dither’s website (e.g., dither.chat), any associated Dither applications, tools, and services, and any public source-code repositories or developer tools provided by us in connection with Dither. These are collectively referred to as the “Services” in this Policy.</p>
<p>The Services do not include third-party platforms that you may access through Dither (such as external websites, the AtomOne blockchain itself, or third-party wallet software). Those external platforms have their own privacy policies and data practices. For example, if you follow a link to an external site or use a wallet extension like Keplr or MetaMask in conjunction with Dither, any data collected by those services is governed by their policies, not ours.</p>

    </h2>
</doc-anchor-target>
<p>By using Dither, you acknowledge that you have read and understood this Privacy Policy. If you do not want us to collect or use your personal data as described, you should not use or interact with the Services. When required by law, we will seek your explicit consent for certain data processing activities, but generally, using the Services signifies your consent to this Policy.</p>

    </h2>
</doc-anchor-target>
<p>We collect various types of information from and about Dither users. In this section, we describe the categories of information we collect and how we collect it.</p>
<doc-anchor-target id="31-information-you-provide-to-us">
    <h3>
        <doc-anchor-trigger class="header-anchor-trigger" to="#31-information-you-provide-to-us">#</doc-anchor-trigger>
        <span><strong>3.1 Information You Provide to Us</strong></span>
    </h3>
</doc-anchor-target>
<p>We collect the content and information that you directly provide when using Dither, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Account or Profile Information:</strong> Dither authenticates users through blockchain wallets rather than traditional accounts*.* Profile information is minimal unless you choose to add details.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Identity Verification Data:</strong> Dither does not require any Know-Your-Customer (KYC) verification for general use. However, if you provide this data for any reason, we will collect and protect it as described. If we ever implement optional or required identity verification, you might provide information such as your name, address, date of birth, telephone number, or government-issued identification documents.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Contact Information:</strong> If you provide your email address or phone number (for example, to subscribe to updates, for support requests, or if it’s required for account recovery), we collect those contact details.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Communications with Us:</strong> If you contact us directly (for example, through a support email or feedback form), we will receive your contact information and the contents of your communication. This could include support inquiries, survey responses, or bug reports.</p>
</li>
<li><p>​​<strong>Transactional Information:</strong> If you conduct transactions through Dither, we collect information about the transaction. This can include your blockchain wallet address, the recipient’s address, the amount, timestamp, and any asset type. Note that many such details are also recorded on the public blockchain.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>User-Generated Content:</strong> Content you create or share on Dither, such as the messages you send in chat, any posts or comments (if those features exist), or other materials. This content may include text, images, or other media. Important: Dither messages are recorded on the AtomOne blockchain, which is public and immutable. Anything you publish via Dither may be permanently available to the public via the blockchain.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Other Information:</strong> Any other information you directly provide to us for specific purposes. For example, if we run a beta signup and you fill out a form with certain details, or if you participate in a community forum or event and provide information.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Please do not provide personal data that is not requested or that you are not comfortable sharing. In general, avoid sharing sensitive personal details on a public chat platform like Dither.</p>

        <doc-anchor-trigger class="header-anchor-trigger" to="#32-information-we-collect-automatically">#</doc-anchor-trigger>
        <span><strong>3.2 Information We Collect Automatically</strong></span>
    </h3>
</doc-anchor-target>
<p>When you use Dither, we automatically collect certain information about your device and usage of the Services. This includes:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Usage Data:</strong> We collect information about how you interact with Dither. This may include details of your activities. For example, we might log that a user with a certain wallet address posted a number of messages in a given time frame or interacted with a particular feature. Importantly, Dither does not monitor the private content of your on-chain messages beyond storing them on the blockchain as needed to provide the service.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Log Data:</strong> Like many online services, we keep logs of certain events. When you use Dither, our servers record information (“log data”), such as the Internet Protocol (IP) address you use to access Dither, the date and time you access the Services, and certain events (like errors or crashes). If you perform blockchain transactions via Dither, we might log the transaction hash or ID and associate it with your session for performance and troubleshooting purposes.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Device and Software Information:</strong> We collect information about the devices and software you use to access Dither. This may include details such as your device type (e.g., laptop, Android phone), operating system and version, browser type and version, the Dither app version (if applicable), device identifiers (like a mobile advertising ID or hardware ID), language settings, and region. We might also collect information about how your device interacts with our Services, like screen resolution or support for certain features.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Analytics Information:</strong> We use analytics services to better understand aggregate user behavior. For example, we currently use Plausible Analytics (a privacy-focused analytics tool) to gather information on usage of our site . Plausible may collect data such as page views, referral sources, and basic browser and device info. Notably, Plausible does not store raw IP addresses; it uses them only momentarily to determine approximate location (country/region) and then discards them. We do not use Google Analytics or other invasive analytics that track individual profiles; Plausible provides aggregate stats which help us improve Dither while respecting user privacy. (Plausible also honors “Do Not Track” signals, which aligns with our approach, though generally our site doesn’t recognize browser DNT for any other third-party since we don’t have those trackers).</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Cookies and Local Storage:</strong> We may use cookies and similar technologies to collect additional website usage data and to improve our Services. For instance, cookies help with managing user sessions and remembering preferences. We do not use cookies for third-party advertising on Dither. You have choices with cookies: you can refuse or delete cookies via your browser settings. However, note that if you disable cookies, some parts of Dither may not function properly (for example, you might be unable to stay logged in or might lose certain preference settings).</p>
<p><em>(See the “Cookies and Similar Technologies” section below for more detail on our use of cookies. Dither currently does not respond to “Do Not Track” signals due to the lack of an industry standard, but we will update this policy if that changes.)</em></p>
</li>
</ul>

    <h3>
        <doc-anchor-trigger class="header-anchor-trigger" to="#33-blockchain-data-on-chain-data">#</doc-anchor-trigger>
        <span><strong>3.3 Blockchain Data (On-Chain Data)</strong></span>
    </h3>
</doc-anchor-target>
<p>Because Dither is built on the AtomOne blockchain, certain personal data will be recorded on a public, decentralized blockchain ledger as an inherent part of providing the service. This includes:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Wallet Addresses:</strong> To use Dither, you will use a cryptocurrency wallet. The public address of any blockchain account (your wallet address) that you use with Dither may be stored on the blockchain as part of transactions. A wallet address can be considered personal data if it can be linked to you.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Chat Messages and Content:</strong> Dither’s chats are designed to be transparent and uncensorable by recording messages on-chain. Any message content or data you broadcast via Dither will be embedded in blockchain transactions, meaning it becomes part of the public ledger. This data can include the text of your messages and any associated metadata. Once on the blockchain, this data is immutable (cannot be altered or deleted) and publicly accessible to anyone running a node or using a blockchain explorer. <strong>Please be aware:</strong> posting personal or sensitive information in a Dither message is effectively publishing it to the world permanently. We strongly advise against sharing personal data in Dither messages.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Transaction Metadata:</strong> Every message or action on Dither that triggers a blockchain transaction will result in associated metadata on-chain, such as transaction IDs/hashes, timestamps, block numbers, and network fees paid (gas fees). All of this information is public by the nature of the blockchain.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Token Balances and Transfers:</strong> If Dither integrates cryptocurrency features (like tipping or token transfers within the chat), details of those transfers (e.g., from address A to address B, amount, token type) are recorded on-chain. Public blockchain data could also show your address’s balance of certain tokens and history of transactions, which observers might analyze to infer information about you.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Important:</strong> Because of blockchain’s decentralized design, we do not control data on the blockchain and cannot delete or modify it. Blockchain data is replicated across many systems globally and is resilient to alteration. This characteristic is great for censorship-resistance but complicates privacy. By using Dither, you are consenting to your data being written to and shared on a public ledger. If you are not comfortable with that, do not use Dither.</p>

        <span><strong>3.4 Information from Third-Party Partners</strong></span>
    </h3>
</doc-anchor-target>
<p>We may receive information about you from third parties in certain scenarios, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Social Media or Email Logins:</strong> If we enable login or account linking via services like Google, GitHub, or others, and you choose to use that option, we might collect information from that provider (such as your name, username, profile picture, or email associated with that account). We will only receive the information you authorize through the third-party login process.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Crypto Wallet Providers:</strong> If you connect a third-party cryptocurrency wallet (like Keplr, MetaMask, etc.), we may receive from that wallet provider confirmation of your account address and perhaps some basic technical information (like your public key). We do not receive your private keys from any wallet providers. The use of any third-party wallet is subject to that wallet’s own privacy policy.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Service Providers:</strong> We might get information from service providers who help us operate Dither. For example, if we use a third-party platform to send out email newsletters or to handle support tickets, they might pass us data you provided to them (like your email address or the contents of a support question) so that we can fulfill those functions.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Other Users:</strong> If another user provides information about you (for instance, if a user invites you to Dither via an email address, or mentions you in a message, or posts content that includes your personal information), we will collect that as part of the platform’s operation. We treat such information in accordance with this Policy, but please note it may also be visible on the blockchain as content that the other user posted.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Advertising and Analytics Partners:</strong> Currently, Dither does not display third-party ads. If that changes, we might receive data from advertising networks about ad performance or audience segments. We might also receive aggregate demographic or interest data from analytics providers, which help us understand our user base generally. As of now, our analytics, such as using Plausible, focus on anonymized aggregate data rather than personal profiles.</p>
</li>
</ul>

        <doc-anchor-trigger class="header-anchor-trigger" to="#35-cookies-and-similar-technologies">#</doc-anchor-trigger>
        <span><strong>3.5 Cookies and Similar Technologies</strong></span>
    </h3>
</doc-anchor-target>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Cookies:</strong> As mentioned, we may use cookies and similar technologies to collect additional usage data and improve our Services. For example, cookies help manage user sessions and remember interface preferences. We do not presently use cookies for advertising purposes on Dither.</p>
<p><strong>Your Choices:</strong> When you first visit, we may present a cookie notice with options. You can remove or reject cookies via your browser or device settings. However, refusing cookies could affect the availability and functionality of Dither (e.g., you might have to manually approve actions more frequently, or lose preference settings). If you disable cookies, certain portions of the Services may not work properly.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Do Not Track:</strong> Some browsers send “Do Not Track” (DNT) signals. Due to the lack of a standard, our Services currently do not respond to DNT signals beyond what our analytics provider (Plausible) automatically does (Plausible already does not collect personal data). We will update this Policy if we implement a response to DNT in the future.</p>
</li>

<doc-anchor-target id="4-how-we-use-your-information">
    <h2>
        <doc-anchor-trigger class="header-anchor-trigger" to="#4-how-we-use-your-information">#</doc-anchor-trigger>
        <span><strong>4. How We Use Your Information</strong></span>
    </h2>
</doc-anchor-target>
<p>We use the collected information for various purposes consistent with the operation of Dither and as described in this Policy. The primary purposes include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Provide and Maintain the Service:</strong> We use your information to deliver Dither’s core functionality to you. For example, we use your public wallet address to route your messages on the blockchain and to display which posts belong to you, and to allow you to send/receive tokens if applicable. We use log and device info to ensure the service displays correctly and operates with your device (for example, ensuring the interface works on your screen size and browser). Essentially, all the data we collect has a functional reason, without it, Dither wouldn’t work or wouldn’t work as well.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Product Development and Research:</strong> We use data to help develop new features and to conduct research and analysis on our user base. For example, analyzing how users engage with a beta feature can inform refinements before full release. We may run surveys or solicit feedback (on a voluntary basis) to guide Dither’s development. All of this usage aims to make Dither better and to innovate in the decentralized social networking space.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Analytics and Performance:</strong> As noted, we use analytics data (like what Plausible provides) to understand traffic patterns, usage volumes, and performance metrics. This helps us ensure the Service is reliable and efficient. For example, log data might tell us if certain times of day have heavy usage, indicating we may need to scale our infrastructure or optimize code.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Safety and Security:</strong> We use information to promote the safety, security, and integrity of Dither. This includes efforts to detect and prevent fraud, abuse, and other harmful activity on the platform. For example, we might analyze logs and on-chain patterns to spot spam or detect accounts engaging in harassment or illegal behavior. If certain IP addresses are overloading our servers or if a pattern suggests a botnet, we’ll use that data to mitigate the threat (such as rate-limiting or blocking those connections). We may also use data to verify accounts and investigate suspicious activity. Bear in mind, Dither’s decentralized nature limits some control over content on the blockchain, but we will use whatever off-chain data we have, like interface logs, to keep the community safe.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Communication with Users:</strong> We may use your contact information (if provided) to send you service-related communications. For example, we might send a verification email if you sign up with an email address, or important announcements like updates to terms or privacy policy, security alerts, or new feature rollouts. If you opt-in, we might send newsletters or marketing communications about Dither or related projects; you can opt out of those at any time. We also use your information to respond when you contact us, for support or feedback, we’ll use your info to address your issue and follow up.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Compliance with Legal Obligations:</strong> We process data as required to comply with applicable laws and regulations. This could include retaining certain transaction records for financial compliance, responding to lawful requests by government authorities, or using data to exercise legal rights (like defending against a lawsuit). If the law requires us to keep logs for a certain time or to report certain activities, we will do so.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Enforce Terms and Policies:</strong> We may use data to enforce our Terms and other policies (such as community content standards). For instance, if we need to investigate a Terms violation, we might review relevant logs or on-chain content that was reported. If necessary, we will use data to ban or restrict accounts that abuse our platform (recognizing that we can only restrict use of <em>our</em> interfaces and cannot erase on-chain data).</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Aggregate and Anonymize:</strong> We often aggregate or de-identify personal data so that it no longer identifies an individual, and use that for purposes like academic research, analytics, or improving advertising effectiveness (if we ever introduce ads) without identifying users. For example, we might publish usage statistics or share the number of weekly active users in an anonymized fashion.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>No AI Model Training</strong>: We do not use your personal data to train machine learning or artificial intelligence models. If that practice ever changes in the future, we will update this Privacy Policy and, if required, seek your permission beforehand.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We strive to use the minimum amount of data needed for each purpose and to respect privacy at each step (for example, by using privacy-focused analytics and avoiding third-party trackers). Our use of data is primarily to provide a functional, secure, and continually improving service for our users.</p>
<doc-anchor-target id="5-how-we-share-or-disclose-information">
    <h2>
        <doc-anchor-trigger class="header-anchor-trigger" to="#5-how-we-share-or-disclose-information">#</doc-anchor-trigger>
        <span><strong>5. How We Share or Disclose Information</strong></span>
    </h2>
</doc-anchor-target>
<p>We understand that your personal data is important, and we are not in the business of selling it. We share information only in the following circumstances:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>With Other Users or the Public:</strong> Any information you post or transact via Dither’s blockchain integration is shared with the public by design. This includes your on-chain messages and content (which are visible to anyone on the AtomOne blockchain or via Dither’s interface), your public blockchain address and Dither profile (if you have set up a profile), and any actions you take that are inherently social or public. For example, if you send a message, anyone on Dither or anyone monitoring the blockchain can see that message and the address that sent it. Similarly, if you “like” or react to content (if such a feature exists), others may see that action associated with your address or profile. We may also, as part of community engagement, repost or highlight content that you have made public (such as quoting a mention on an external social media account, or showcasing a popular public Dither thread on a blog). We will not disclose private communications with us (like support emails) publicly, except with your permission or in anonymized form.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Service Providers and Partners:</strong> We employ third-party companies and individuals to help us operate and improve Dither (for example, cloud hosting providers, software development contractors, analytics providers, email service providers). These service providers may process your information on our behalf for tasks like data storage, server maintenance, email delivery, customer support, or analytics. We share with them only the information necessary for them to perform their functions, and we contractually bind them to protect your data and use it only for the purposes we specify. For instance, our hosting provider stores our databases and therefore technically has your data on its servers, but they cannot legally use it for anything except storing and retrieving it as needed to run our service. We ensure any service provider we use is required to adhere to standards at least as protective as those in this Privacy Policy.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Affiliates:</strong> All In Bits, Inc. is part of a broader ecosystem of projects. We may share information with our corporate affiliates (entities that are under common ownership or control with All In Bits). Any affiliates will be bound to treat such information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Sharing with affiliates might occur, for example, for internal administrative purposes or if resources are shared across projects (e.g., a support team that handles inquiries for multiple products including Dither).</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Business Transfers:</strong> If All In Bits, Inc. is involved in a merger, acquisition, sale of assets, or similar corporate transaction, user information may be transferred to the successor or new owner as part of that deal. We would ensure the new owner continues to be bound by privacy obligations at least as stringent as those here. If such a transfer is subject to additional conditions by law, we will comply (for example, obtaining your consent where required). We will notify users (for example, via a notice on the site or an email) of any change in ownership or use of your personal data, as well as any choices you may have regarding your data, in the event of such a transaction.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Legal Requirements and Safety:</strong> We may disclose your information when we have a good-faith belief that such disclosure is necessary to do one or more of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Comply with the law or legal process:</strong> This includes responding to subpoenas, warrants, court orders, or other legal requests. Given Dither’s decentralized nature, our ability to produce certain data may be limited, and a lot of content is publicly viewable on the blockchain anyway, but if we are legally compelled and able to assist, we will obey the law.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Protect against or prevent fraud, security issues, or harm:</strong> We might share information with law enforcement or relevant institutions if we believe it’s reasonably necessary to detect or prevent illegal activities, fraud, or imminent harm to someone’s rights, property, or safety. For example, if we detect an account engaged in distributing malware or threats via Dither, we might report relevant info to authorities.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Enforce our Terms and policies:</strong> Information may be shared as needed to enforce our agreements or to investigate violations. This might involve sharing data with legal counsel or forensic consultants.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Address emergencies:</strong> In emergency situations (imminent danger of death or serious physical injury to any person), we may disclose information to law enforcement or others who can address the emergency, as permitted by applicable law.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Regulatory and Compliance:</strong> If necessary, we may share information with regulatory bodies or auditors. For instance, to the extent Dither’s operations ever fall under certain financial regulations, we might need to share user transaction data with regulators like the U.S. SEC, FINRA, or analogous international bodies, but only as required by law. We may also share information to comply with anti-money laundering (AML) and similar regulations if applicable in the future, which could involve sharing data with identity verification services or government entities.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Third-Party Integrations:</strong> Dither may integrate with third-party services (for example, a GIF image provider for adding images to chats, or a link preview service). If you choose to engage with those features, some data (like your IP address or the content of a request) might be shared with that third-party to fulfill the request (e.g., fetching a preview of a link might tell the preview service your IP and the link you are interested in). We will inform you within the app when a feature is powered by a third party, to the extent possible, so you know when another service’s privacy policy might apply.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>With Your Consent:</strong> In cases other than those above, if we ever need to share your information for a new purpose, we will ask for your consent. For example, if we want to feature your testimonial or success story on our website, we would ask for your permission before using your name or content.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>No Selling of Personal Data:</strong> We do not sell your personal information to third parties for profit, and we have not done so in the past. Any sharing of personal data is only done as described above.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Blockchain Data:</strong> Remember that data on the AtomOne blockchain (and other public blockchains) is by its nature shared and publicly accessible. In a sense, by using Dither’s blockchain features, you are publishing data. We cannot control how third parties (like other users, blockchain explorers, or data aggregators) access or use that public blockchain data. For example, third parties might aggregate Dither posts, analyze blockchain transactions to try to de-anonymize addresses, or reuse content in unintended ways. This is outside the scope of what we (All In Bits) do with your data, but it’s important you understand that this kind of broad sharing is inherent in blockchain use.</p>
<p>We only share the data we must, and we carefully evaluate all requests and agreements to ensure your privacy is respected.</p>

        <span><strong>6. International Data Transfers</strong></span>
    </h2>
</doc-anchor-target>
<p>Dither is a global service, and your information may be transferred to or stored in multiple countries, including the United States. Specifically, our company is based in the USA, and our servers and service providers may be located in the U.S. or other jurisdictions. This means that your personal data may be processed outside of your home country, and those locations may have different data protection laws than your country.</p>
<p>If you are located in the European Economic Area (EEA), the United Kingdom, or other regions with laws governing data collection and use that differ from U.S. law, please note that we will transfer data to the U.S. and possibly other countries. We rely on legal mechanisms to ensure adequate data protection for such international transfers. These might include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Using contracts such as the European Commission’s Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) with our service providers to ensure that they protect EEA/UK personal data according to EU standards.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Ensuring recipients of the data are certified under frameworks like the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (once applicable/approved) or a similar arrangement, if available.</p>
</li>
<li><p>In some cases, transferring data with your explicit consent where appropriate (for example, if you explicitly request a service that necessitates the transfer of your information to a different country).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Regardless of where your data is processed, we apply the same protections described in this Policy. We also monitor developments in international data transfer law and adjust our practices to remain compliant.</p>
<p>By using Dither or providing us with information, you consent to the transfer of your personal information to the United States and other countries which may have different data protection rules than your country. We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy wherever it is processed.</p>
<p>If you have questions about our transfer mechanisms or want more information about cross-border data transfer safeguards, you can contact us (see the “Contact Us” section below).</p>

        <span><strong>7. Data Retention</strong></span>
    </h2>
</doc-anchor-target>
<p>We retain your personal data only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected, as described in this Privacy Policy, or as required by law. Because different types of data have different purposes, retention periods can vary:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>On-Chain Data:</strong> Data written to the AtomOne blockchain (such as Dither posts, transactions, and addresses) is retained <em><strong>indefinitely</strong></em> on the public ledger by design. We do not have the ability to alter or delete blockchain history. <strong>Effectively, on-chain personal data is permanent. Consider this carefully when using Dither.</strong></p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Account and Profile Data:</strong> If Dither has user accounts or profile data stored off-chain and you deactivate or delete your account, we will remove or anonymize personal data associated with your account within a reasonable timeframe, except as noted below. Some residual data (like logs associated with your user ID) might remain in backups for a short period (generally not more than 90 days) but will be deleted according to our backup retention schedule. If your account was essentially just an on-chain wallet (with minimal off-chain data), there may not be much “account” data for us to delete on our side; in such cases, deleting your account simply means you stop using Dither (the on-chain data remains on the blockchain).</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Log and Analytics Data:</strong> We generally retain web server logs and anonymized analytics data for a limited period to support troubleshooting, analysis, and compliance. For example, basic logs might be kept for a few weeks or months, and aggregated analytics data might be kept longer. We aim to remove or anonymize data in a reasonable timeframe when it’s no longer needed (e.g., “rolling” deletion of logs older than a certain number of days). If data is deleted from our live systems, it may persist in secure backups until those backups are overwritten, but we will not restore personal data from backups except as needed for disaster recovery or if legally required.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Legal and Compliance:</strong> We might retain data longer if necessary to comply with legal obligations or to protect legal rights. For example, certain transaction records might be kept for a number of years to comply with financial or tax regulations, or information relevant to a dispute might be retained until that issue is resolved. We also retain data as necessary to enforce our Terms or to resolve disputes. Any such data will be maintained only as long as required for those purposes.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>When we no longer have a legitimate need to retain your personal information, we will securely delete, anonymize, or isolate it, as appropriate. If you have specific questions about retention of certain data, you can contact us (see Contact section).</p>

        <span><strong>8. Your Rights and Choices</strong></span>
    </h2>
</doc-anchor-target>
<p>Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have certain rights regarding your personal data. We extend core privacy rights to all Dither users where feasible, and we specifically ensure compliance with rights granted under laws such as the EU/UK General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Below, we outline your rights and how you can exercise them. Please note that these rights are not absolute and may be subject to conditions or limitations under applicable law (for example, some rights do not apply to data made public by the user, like blockchain posts).</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Access and Portability:</strong> You have the right to request a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to obtain information about how we process it. For blockchain data, note that it’s already publicly accessible (you can use any AtomOne block explorer to see your on-chain actions associated with your address). For off-chain data (such as any profile or account information we store, or support communications), you can request that we provide you with that information in a common electronic format. This is sometimes called the right to data portability.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Rectification (Correction):</strong> If any personal data we have is incorrect or incomplete, you have the right to ask us to correct or update it. For example, if you change your email address or if we somehow recorded your name incorrectly in our systems, let us know and we will fix it. We cannot change historical blockchain records (nothing can), but off-chain profile info or other data we maintain can be updated.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Deletion (Right to be Forgotten):</strong> You may request that we delete your personal data under certain circumstances. For example, if you no longer want to use Dither, you can ask us to delete your account and associated off-chain personal data. We will do so unless we are required to retain it (for example, for legal compliance or if the data is still necessary for the purpose it was collected). <strong>Keep in mind:</strong> we cannot delete data that is stored on the blockchain. On-chain data is beyond our control and typically cannot be removed by anyone. We will, however, remove references to on-chain content in our own systems. For example, if you request account deletion, we can stop showing your Dither messages in the Dither interface, but the raw data will remain on-chain and accessible through the blockchain.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Restriction of Processing:</strong> In certain situations, you have the right to ask us to limit how we’re using your data (for instance, to stop processing but not delete it, in cases where you need the data preserved for a legal claim or you dispute its accuracy). This right is typically applicable if you contest the accuracy of the data or if our processing is unlawful and you oppose full erasure. When processing is restricted, we can still store your data but not use it for other purposes until the restriction is lifted.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Objection to Processing:</strong> You can object to certain processing of your data if it is being done under a legal basis of legitimate interests or public interest. For example, if we were processing your data for direct marketing (which we currently do not do without your consent), you could object and opt out of that marketing. You can also object to processing for research or statistical purposes in some cases. We will honor such objections unless we have compelling legitimate grounds to continue or if the data is needed for legal claims or other overriding purposes permitted by law.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Automated Decision-Making:</strong> Dither does not use your personal data for any purely automated decisions that produce legal or similarly significant effects about you. In other words, we are not subjecting you to decisions based solely on automated processing (like algorithmic decisions without human involvement) that significantly affect your rights or interests. If that ever changes (for example, if in the future we implemented an AI-based moderation system making binding decisions on content or access), you would have rights regarding such processing, including the right to request human review of the decision. We would also update this Policy to reflect such a change.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Consent Withdrawal:</strong> If you have provided consent for any optional processing of personal data, you can withdraw that consent at any time. For instance, if you consented to receive promotional emails or newsletters, you can opt out by clicking “unsubscribe” in those emails or by contacting us to have your name removed. Withdrawal of consent will not affect the lawfulness of any processing that happened before you withdrew consent. Do note that if you withdraw consent for something necessary to provide the service (for example, if you had given consent to store your email address for login or notifications and you withdraw it), you might lose access to that feature of Dither. As an example, if you withdraw consent for us to store your email, you would not receive account recovery emails or certain alerts.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>To exercise any of these rights, please contact us at <strong><a href="mailto:legal@tendermint.com">legal@tendermint.com</a></strong> or use the contact information provided in the Contact Us section below. We may need to verify your identity before fulfilling certain requests (to ensure we don’t give your data to an impostor). We will respond to your request within a reasonable timeframe and in accordance with applicable law. (For EU/UK residents, this generally means within 1 month, extendable by an additional 2 months if necessary, in which case we will inform you of the extension.)</p>
<p>If you are in the EEA or UK and believe we have not complied with your data protection rights, you have the right to lodge a complaint with your local supervisory authority (for example, the Data Protection Commission in Ireland, or the ICO in the UK). We would appreciate the chance to address your concerns first, so we encourage you to contact us directly before involving regulators.</p>

        <span><strong>9. Security Measures</strong></span>
    </h2>
</doc-anchor-target>
<p>We take security seriously and implement reasonable and appropriate measures to protect your personal data from loss, theft, misuse, and unauthorized access or disclosure. Our security program includes:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Encryption:</strong> Where applicable, we use encryption to protect data. For instance, our website and app traffic are encrypted via HTTPS (TLS) to secure data in transit between your device and our servers. Sensitive data that we might store (such as passwords, if any) are stored in hashed or encrypted form. On-chain data is by design transparent, so encryption mainly applies to data in our systems. Also, remember that your blockchain private keys are managed by you. We never ask for or hold your private keys.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Access Controls:</strong> We limit access to personal data to employees, contractors, and agents who need to know that information in order to operate, develop, or improve Dither. Those who have access are subject to strict contractual confidentiality obligations and may be disciplined or terminated if they fail to meet these obligations. Our systems enforce permissions so that, for example, support staff cannot arbitrarily access sensitive databases unless it is necessary for their job duties.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Monitoring &amp; Testing:</strong> We regularly monitor our systems for possible vulnerabilities and attacks. We employ firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and other monitoring tools to guard against malicious activity. We also periodically test our security measures (through internal reviews and, in some cases, third-party audits or penetration tests) to ensure they remain effective and up-to-date.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Secure Development Practices:</strong> Our engineering processes follow secure coding guidelines. Changes to code are reviewed, and we keep software dependencies updated to patch known security issues promptly. We strive to build security into our platform from the ground up.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Data Minimization:</strong> We aim to collect only the data that we need. Less data retained means less risk. For example, by using Plausible Analytics, we avoid collecting personally identifiable analytics data (like long-term storage of IP addresses). We focus on aggregate data whenever possible.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Incident Response:</strong> We have an incident response plan for dealing with potential data breaches or security incidents. If a breach affecting personal data occurs, we will notify affected users and/or relevant authorities as required by law. We will also take steps to contain the breach and mitigate any harm.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>However, it’s important to note that no system is 100% secure. Blockchain technology, for example, provides robust security through decentralization and cryptography, but user errors (like losing a private key or falling for phishing scams) can compromise individual accounts. We encourage you to also take steps to secure your accounts and data, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Using a strong, unique password for any Dither-related accounts or your email.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Safeguarding your blockchain wallet’s private keys and recovery phrases (consider using hardware wallets for significant assets).</p>
</li>
<li><p>Being wary of phishing attempts. Remember that we will never ask you for your wallet’s private key or seed phrase.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Enabling additional security features we may offer (like two-factor authentication) when they become available.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Keeping your devices secure (updated operating system, antivirus software, and device passwords).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have reason to believe that your interaction with Dither is no longer secure (for example, if you suspect your account or wallet has been compromised), please immediately notify us as described in the Contact Us section below.</p>

        <span><strong>10. Children’s Privacy</strong></span>
    </h2>
</doc-anchor-target>
<p>Dither is not intended for use by anyone under the age of 18. We do not knowingly collect personal data from children under 18 years of age. If you are under 18, please do not use Dither or provide any personal information to us.</p>
<p>As stated in our Terms, individuals under 18 are not permitted to use the Services. We do not knowingly allow such individuals to register or post personal data. If we discover that a person under 18 has provided us with personal information, we will take steps to delete that information promptly, except to the extent it’s on the blockchain, which we cannot erase. This is another reason minors should not use Dither, since their on-chain activity is permanent.</p>
<p>Parents or guardians: If you become aware that your minor child (under 18) has provided us with personal information, please contact us so that we can delete it. We may ask for proof that you are the child’s parent or guardian before honoring such a request.</p>
<p>Because of the nature of Dither (publishing to a public blockchain), even if we act to remove an under-18 user’s data from systems we control, some data (like messages already written to the blockchain) cannot be deleted. We will, however, do what we can, such as disabling the account, removing it from our interface, and preventing further use, to mitigate exposure. Ultimately, the permanence of blockchain records is one more reason we strongly discourage any minors from using Dither.</p>

        <span><strong>11. Regional Privacy Notices</strong></span>
    </h2>
</doc-anchor-target>
<p>We understand that privacy laws and expectations can vary by region. Dither is committed to complying with applicable privacy regulations in all jurisdictions where we operate. Below are additional notices and clarifications for users in certain regions:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>California (CCPA/CPRA): If you are a California resident, you have specific privacy rights under the California Consumer Privacy Act (as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act). These include the right to know what personal information we collect, the right to request deletion of your personal information, the right to request correction of inaccurate personal information, and the right to opt out of the “sale” or “sharing” of your personal information. We want to clarify that, as described in this Policy, we do not sell or share your personal information as those terms are defined in California law. Because we do not monetize your data in that way, the opt-out right is not applicable. You also have the right not to receive discriminatory treatment for exercising your privacy rights. The rights to access, delete, and correct information can be exercised as described in Section 8 above (Your Rights and Choices). If you have any questions about how California privacy law applies to Dither, feel free to contact us.</p>
</li>
<li><p>EEA and UK (GDPR): If you are in the European Economic Area or the United Kingdom, we process your personal data in accordance with the EU and UK General Data Protection Regulation. That means we ensure you can exercise all the rights outlined in Section 8 above. We have also described our data practices, such as the purposes of processing and the categories of data, in line with GDPR requirements. For individuals in these regions, the legal bases for our processing include: (1) Contractual necessity, as we process data to provide you with the Dither service you requested (for example, processing your on-chain posts as part of the service); (2) Legitimate interests, such as maintaining the security of the platform and improving our services (we only rely on legitimate interests where we believe our use of data is not overridden by your privacy rights); and (3) Compliance with legal obligations, where we process and retain data as needed to comply with laws. We do not use your personal data for any purpose that would require consent under the GDPR without obtaining your consent (for instance, we currently do not use your data for direct marketing or automated profiling without consent). If you believe your privacy rights under GDPR have been infringed, you have the right to lodge a complaint with your local Data Protection Authority, as noted above. However, we hope to resolve any issues directly if you contact us first.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Other Regions: No matter where you are located, we aim to respect your privacy and comply with applicable laws. If your country or region grants you additional privacy rights beyond those described here, we will honor those rights to the extent required by law. All In Bits, Inc. is the operator of Dither globally, and there are no separate local operating entities. This Privacy Policy is intended to be a comprehensive statement of our practices for users worldwide. Nothing in this Policy is intended to limit any rights or protections you may have under the laws of your jurisdiction. If you have questions about how we handle data in your region, you can always reach out to us for clarification.</p>

        <span><strong>12. Changes to this Privacy Policy</strong></span>
    </h2>
</doc-anchor-target>
<p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices, technologies, legal requirements, or for other reasons. When we make changes, we will:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Post the updated Privacy Policy on our website (and in the app, if applicable) with a new “Last Updated” date.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Notify you of significant changes. If the changes are material, we will provide a more prominent notice (such as a banner on the site, an in-app alert, or an email notification) explaining the updates. For example, if we change the types of data we collect or how we use it in a significant way, you’ll be informed and may be prompted to review the new terms.</p>
</li>
<li><p>If required by law, we may also seek your consent for certain changes (for instance, if a new use of data is materially different and legal standards require obtaining consent).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically to stay informed about our data practices and any updates. Your continued use of Dither after any changes to this Policy constitutes your acceptance of the updated terms (to the extent permitted by law). If you do not agree with any changes, you should stop using Dither and can request that we delete your data as outlined in Section 8.</p>
<p>For historical reference, we may keep prior versions of this Privacy Policy accessible or available upon request so you can see how our practices have evolved.</p>
