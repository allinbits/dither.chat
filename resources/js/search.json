[[{"l":"About Dither","p":["Dither is a public protocol for publishing messages onchain. It is designed to be simple, durable, and open to extension by anyone.","At its core, Dither is a read-optimized, event-sourced messaging protocol. It indexes a specific subset of memos from any compatible blockchain (currently AtomOne), reconstructs application state from those events, and exposes that state through a public API.","This is done through two key components:","Dither Service","A backend that monitors the blockchain, processes memo events, and reconstructs user and post data. This state is made available through a REST API.","Dither Website","A lightweight frontend that connects to the API and lets users post, browse, follow others, and reflect content. It is fully stateless and will soon be open source.","These components are designed to be decoupled. Anyone can run their own version of the service, build their own client, or use the protocol in a completely different way. Dither is not a platform. It is a protocol and reference implementation.","Dither avoids algorithmic feeds, editing tools, and moderation queues. It is minimal by design.","All content is public and stored permanently onchain. This structure creates space for users and communities to define their own norms, tooling, and experience.","Developers can run their own indexers, fork the client, or build custom frontends using the public API."]}],[{"i":"#","p":["We will never ask you for your private keys, or mnemonic phrase. Never share this information with anyone else."]},{"l":"FAQ","p":["Information for people who have questions about Dither and how it works."]},{"l":"How does dither work?","p":["Dither pushes messages to the AtomOne blockchain using a specific format.","For posting, the memo must be dither.Post(My message goes here)","As long as the message is sent to the address atone1uq6zjslvsa29cy6uu75y8txnl52mw06j6fzlep it will be indexed."]},{"l":"Can I upload images?","p":["No, instead you can link to other third-party providers who will be image hosts. This prevents nefarious content from being uploaded to the chain.

This fee is to cover the operational cost of keeping our service alive. This tiny fee allows us to index your message, reply, or like. The rest is paid to the network validators who process and permanently store the data on the blockchain."]},{"l":"Can messages be deleted?","p":["No, they cannot be deleted. However, Dither does reserve the right to hide a message. However, you as a user will always have access to these messages as they are always available on-chain, if you go looking for them."]}],[{"l":"Protocol","p":["The protocol is incredibly simple and works entirely through memos.","There is a 512 byte limit on all inputs, so ensure your post is within 512 bytes.","The larger your post in the memo is, the more gas you will need."]},{"l":"Where to Send?","p":["Dither works with the bank module using the message MsgSend type.","Which is a fancy way of saying make a transfer and send at least 0.000001 PHOTON to have your message indexed.","The receiving address must be atone1uq6zjslvsa29cy6uu75y8txnl52mw06j6fzlep"]},{"l":"Protocol Examples"}],[{"i":"#","p":["We will never ask you for your private keys, or mnemonic phrase.

(“we” or “us”) collects, uses, discloses, and protects your personal data when you use Dither. It is designed to help you understand our data practices and your rights.","This Privacy Policy is an integral part of Dither’s Terms and Conditions (the “Terms”). All definitions and terms used in the Terms have the same meaning in this Privacy Policy. By using Dither, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with our practices, do not use Dither.","Incorporation with Terms: For full context, remember that this Privacy Policy is incorporated into the Terms. That means issues like limitations on liability and dispute resolution (including arbitration) that apply to the Terms also apply to this Privacy Policy."]},{"l":"1. Operator and Scope","p":["All In Bits, Inc., a Delaware corporation (referred to as the “operator,” “we,” or “us”), operates Dither and is the data controller for personal information processed through Dither. This Policy applies to the use of Dither’s website (e.g., dither.chat), any associated Dither applications, tools, and services, and any public source-code repositories or developer tools provided by us in connection with Dither. These are collectively referred to as the “Services” in this Policy.","The Services do not include third-party platforms that you may access through Dither (such as external websites, the AtomOne blockchain itself, or third-party wallet software). Those external platforms have their own privacy policies and data practices. For example, if you follow a link to an external site or use a wallet extension like Keplr or MetaMask in conjunction with Dither, any data collected by those services is governed by their policies, not ours."]},{"l":"2. Acceptance of Policy","p":["By using Dither, you acknowledge that you have read and understood this Privacy Policy. If you do not want us to collect or use your personal data as described, you should not use or interact with the Services. When required by law, we will seek your explicit consent for certain data processing activities, but generally, using the Services signifies your consent to this Policy."]},{"l":"3. Personal Data We Collect","p":["We collect various types of information from and about Dither users. In this section, we describe the categories of information we collect and how we collect it."]},{"l":"3.1 Information You Provide to Us","p":["We collect the content and information that you directly provide when using Dither, including:","Account or Profile Information: Dither authenticates users through blockchain wallets rather than traditional accounts*.* Profile information is minimal unless you choose to add details.","Identity Verification Data: Dither does not require any Know-Your-Customer (KYC) verification for general use. However, if you provide this data for any reason, we will collect and protect it as described. If we ever implement optional or required identity verification, you might provide information such as your name, address, date of birth, telephone number, or government-issued identification documents.","Contact Information: If you provide your email address or phone number (for example, to subscribe to updates, for support requests, or if it’s required for account recovery), we collect those contact details.","Communications with Us: If you contact us directly (for example, through a support email or feedback form), we will receive your contact information and the contents of your communication. This could include support inquiries, survey responses, or bug reports.","​​ Transactional Information: If you conduct transactions through Dither, we collect information about the transaction. This can include your blockchain wallet address, the recipient’s address, the amount, timestamp, and any asset type. Note that many such details are also recorded on the public blockchain.","User-Generated Content: Content you create or share on Dither, such as the messages you send in chat, any posts or comments (if those features exist), or other materials. This content may include text, images, or other media. Important: Dither messages are recorded on the AtomOne blockchain, which is public and immutable. Anything you publish via Dither may be permanently available to the public via the blockchain.","Other Information: Any other information you directly provide to us for specific purposes. For example, if we run a beta signup and you fill out a form with certain details, or if you participate in a community forum or event and provide information.","Please do not provide personal data that is not requested or that you are not comfortable sharing. In general, avoid sharing sensitive personal details on a public chat platform like Dither."]},{"l":"3.2 Information We Collect Automatically","p":["When you use Dither, we automatically collect certain information about your device and usage of the Services. This includes:","Usage Data: We collect information about how you interact with Dither. This may include details of your activities. For example, we might log that a user with a certain wallet address posted a number of messages in a given time frame or interacted with a particular feature. Importantly, Dither does not monitor the private content of your on-chain messages beyond storing them on the blockchain as needed to provide the service.","Log Data: Like many online services, we keep logs of certain events. When you use Dither, our servers record information (“log data”), such as the Internet Protocol (IP) address you use to access Dither, the date and time you access the Services, and certain events (like errors or crashes). If you perform blockchain transactions via Dither, we might log the transaction hash or ID and associate it with your session for performance and troubleshooting purposes.","Device and Software Information: We collect information about the devices and software you use to access Dither. This may include details such as your device type (e.g., laptop, Android phone), operating system and version, browser type and version, the Dither app version (if applicable), device identifiers (like a mobile advertising ID or hardware ID), language settings, and region. We might also collect information about how your device interacts with our Services, like screen resolution or support for certain features.","Analytics Information: We use analytics services to better understand aggregate user behavior. For example, we currently use Plausible Analytics (a privacy-focused analytics tool) to gather information on usage of our site . Plausible may collect data such as page views, referral sources, and basic browser and device info. Notably, Plausible does not store raw IP addresses; it uses them only momentarily to determine approximate location (country/region) and then discards them. We do not use Google Analytics or other invasive analytics that track individual profiles; Plausible provides aggregate stats which help us improve Dither while respecting user privacy. (Plausible also honors “Do Not Track” signals, which aligns with our approach, though generally our site doesn’t recognize browser DNT for any other third-party since we don’t have those trackers).","Cookies and Local Storage: We may use cookies and similar technologies to collect additional website usage data and to improve our Services. For instance, cookies help with managing user sessions and remembering preferences. We do not use cookies for third-party advertising on Dither. You have choices with cookies: you can refuse or delete cookies via your browser settings. However, note that if you disable cookies, some parts of Dither may not function properly (for example, you might be unable to stay logged in or might lose certain preference settings).","(See the “Cookies and Similar Technologies” section below for more detail on our use of cookies. Dither currently does not respond to “Do Not Track” signals due to the lack of an industry standard, but we will update this policy if that changes.)"]},{"l":"3.3 Blockchain Data (On-Chain Data)","p":["Because Dither is built on the AtomOne blockchain, certain personal data will be recorded on a public, decentralized blockchain ledger as an inherent part of providing the service. This includes:","Wallet Addresses: To use Dither, you will use a cryptocurrency wallet. The public address of any blockchain account (your wallet address) that you use with Dither may be stored on the blockchain as part of transactions. A wallet address can be considered personal data if it can be linked to you.","Chat Messages and Content: Dither’s chats are designed to be transparent and uncensorable by recording messages on-chain. Any message content or data you broadcast via Dither will be embedded in blockchain transactions, meaning it becomes part of the public ledger. This data can include the text of your messages and any associated metadata. Once on the blockchain, this data is immutable (cannot be altered or deleted) and publicly accessible to anyone running a node or using a blockchain explorer. Please be aware: posting personal or sensitive information in a Dither message is effectively publishing it to the world permanently. We strongly advise against sharing personal data in Dither messages.","Transaction Metadata: Every message or action on Dither that triggers a blockchain transaction will result in associated metadata on-chain, such as transaction IDs/hashes, timestamps, block numbers, and network fees paid (gas fees). All of this information is public by the nature of the blockchain.","Token Balances and Transfers: If Dither integrates cryptocurrency features (like tipping or token transfers within the chat), details of those transfers (e.g., from address A to address B, amount, token type) are recorded on-chain. Public blockchain data could also show your address’s balance of certain tokens and history of transactions, which observers might analyze to infer information about you.","Important: Because of blockchain’s decentralized design, we do not control data on the blockchain and cannot delete or modify it. Blockchain data is replicated across many systems globally and is resilient to alteration. This characteristic is great for censorship-resistance but complicates privacy. By using Dither, you are consenting to your data being written to and shared on a public ledger. If you are not comfortable with that, do not use Dither."]},{"l":"3.4 Information from Third-Party Partners","p":["We may receive information about you from third parties in certain scenarios, such as:","Social Media or Email Logins: If we enable login or account linking via services like Google, GitHub, or others, and you choose to use that option, we might collect information from that provider (such as your name, username, profile picture, or email associated with that account). We will only receive the information you authorize through the third-party login process.","Crypto Wallet Providers: If you connect a third-party cryptocurrency wallet (like Keplr, MetaMask, etc.), we may receive from that wallet provider confirmation of your account address and perhaps some basic technical information (like your public key). We do not receive your private keys from any wallet providers. The use of any third-party wallet is subject to that wallet’s own privacy policy.","Service Providers: We might get information from service providers who help us operate Dither. For example, if we use a third-party platform to send out email newsletters or to handle support tickets, they might pass us data you provided to them (like your email address or the contents of a support question) so that we can fulfill those functions.","Other Users: If another user provides information about you (for instance, if a user invites you to Dither via an email address, or mentions you in a message, or posts content that includes your personal information), we will collect that as part of the platform’s operation. We treat such information in accordance with this Policy, but please note it may also be visible on the blockchain as content that the other user posted.","Advertising and Analytics Partners: Currently, Dither does not display third-party ads. If that changes, we might receive data from advertising networks about ad performance or audience segments. We might also receive aggregate demographic or interest data from analytics providers, which help us understand our user base generally. As of now, our analytics, such as using Plausible, focus on anonymized aggregate data rather than personal profiles."]},{"l":"3.5 Cookies and Similar Technologies","p":["Cookies: As mentioned, we may use cookies and similar technologies to collect additional usage data and improve our Services. For example, cookies help manage user sessions and remember interface preferences. We do not presently use cookies for advertising purposes on Dither.","Your Choices: When you first visit, we may present a cookie notice with options. You can remove or reject cookies via your browser or device settings. However, refusing cookies could affect the availability and functionality of Dither (e.g., you might have to manually approve actions more frequently, or lose preference settings). If you disable cookies, certain portions of the Services may not work properly.","Do Not Track: Some browsers send “Do Not Track” (DNT) signals. Due to the lack of a standard, our Services currently do not respond to DNT signals beyond what our analytics provider (Plausible) automatically does (Plausible already does not collect personal data). We will update this Policy if we implement a response to DNT in the future."]},{"l":"4. How We Use Your Information","p":["We use the collected information for various purposes consistent with the operation of Dither and as described in this Policy. The primary purposes include:","Provide and Maintain the Service: We use your information to deliver Dither’s core functionality to you. For example, we use your public wallet address to route your messages on the blockchain and to display which posts belong to you, and to allow you to send/receive tokens if applicable. We use log and device info to ensure the service displays correctly and operates with your device (for example, ensuring the interface works on your screen size and browser). Essentially, all the data we collect has a functional reason, without it, Dither wouldn’t work or wouldn’t work as well.","Product Development and Research: We use data to help develop new features and to conduct research and analysis on our user base. For example, analyzing how users engage with a beta feature can inform refinements before full release. We may run surveys or solicit feedback (on a voluntary basis) to guide Dither’s development. All of this usage aims to make Dither better and to innovate in the decentralized social networking space.","Analytics and Performance: As noted, we use analytics data (like what Plausible provides) to understand traffic patterns, usage volumes, and performance metrics. This helps us ensure the Service is reliable and efficient. For example, log data might tell us if certain times of day have heavy usage, indicating we may need to scale our infrastructure or optimize code.","Safety and Security: We use information to promote the safety, security, and integrity of Dither. This includes efforts to detect and prevent fraud, abuse, and other harmful activity on the platform. For example, we might analyze logs and on-chain patterns to spot spam or detect accounts engaging in harassment or illegal behavior. If certain IP addresses are overloading our servers or if a pattern suggests a botnet, we’ll use that data to mitigate the threat (such as rate-limiting or blocking those connections). We may also use data to verify accounts and investigate suspicious activity. Bear in mind, Dither’s decentralized nature limits some control over content on the blockchain, but we will use whatever off-chain data we have, like interface logs, to keep the community safe.","Communication with Users: We may use your contact information (if provided) to send you service-related communications. For example, we might send a verification email if you sign up with an email address, or important announcements like updates to terms or privacy policy, security alerts, or new feature rollouts. If you opt-in, we might send newsletters or marketing communications about Dither or related projects; you can opt out of those at any time. We also use your information to respond when you contact us, for support or feedback, we’ll use your info to address your issue and follow up.","Compliance with Legal Obligations: We process data as required to comply with applicable laws and regulations. This could include retaining certain transaction records for financial compliance, responding to lawful requests by government authorities, or using data to exercise legal rights (like defending against a lawsuit). If the law requires us to keep logs for a certain time or to report certain activities, we will do so.","Enforce Terms and Policies: We may use data to enforce our Terms and other policies (such as community content standards). For instance, if we need to investigate a Terms violation, we might review relevant logs or on-chain content that was reported. If necessary, we will use data to ban or restrict accounts that abuse our platform (recognizing that we can only restrict use of our interfaces and cannot erase on-chain data).","Aggregate and Anonymize: We often aggregate or de-identify personal data so that it no longer identifies an individual, and use that for purposes like academic research, analytics, or improving advertising effectiveness (if we ever introduce ads) without identifying users. For example, we might publish usage statistics or share the number of weekly active users in an anonymized fashion.","No AI Model Training: We do not use your personal data to train machine learning or artificial intelligence models. If that practice ever changes in the future, we will update this Privacy Policy and, if required, seek your permission beforehand.","We strive to use the minimum amount of data needed for each purpose and to respect privacy at each step (for example, by using privacy-focused analytics and avoiding third-party trackers). Our use of data is primarily to provide a functional, secure, and continually improving service for our users."]},{"l":"5. How We Share or Disclose Information","p":["Address emergencies: In emergency situations (imminent danger of death or serious physical injury to any person), we may disclose information to law enforcement or others who can address the emergency, as permitted by applicable law.","Affiliates: All In Bits, Inc. is part of a broader ecosystem of projects. We may share information with our corporate affiliates (entities that are under common ownership or control with All In Bits). Any affiliates will be bound to treat such information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Sharing with affiliates might occur, for example, for internal administrative purposes or if resources are shared across projects (e.g., a support team that handles inquiries for multiple products including Dither).","Blockchain Data: Remember that data on the AtomOne blockchain (and other public blockchains) is by its nature shared and publicly accessible. In a sense, by using Dither’s blockchain features, you are publishing data. We cannot control how third parties (like other users, blockchain explorers, or data aggregators) access or use that public blockchain data. For example, third parties might aggregate Dither posts, analyze blockchain transactions to try to de-anonymize addresses, or reuse content in unintended ways. This is outside the scope of what we (All In Bits) do with your data, but it’s important you understand that this kind of broad sharing is inherent in blockchain use.","Business Transfers: If All In Bits, Inc. is involved in a merger, acquisition, sale of assets, or similar corporate transaction, user information may be transferred to the successor or new owner as part of that deal. We would ensure the new owner continues to be bound by privacy obligations at least as stringent as those here. If such a transfer is subject to additional conditions by law, we will comply (for example, obtaining your consent where required). We will notify users (for example, via a notice on the site or an email) of any change in ownership or use of your personal data, as well as any choices you may have regarding your data, in the event of such a transaction.","Comply with the law or legal process: This includes responding to subpoenas, warrants, court orders, or other legal requests. Given Dither’s decentralized nature, our ability to produce certain data may be limited, and a lot of content is publicly viewable on the blockchain anyway, but if we are legally compelled and able to assist, we will obey the law.","Enforce our Terms and policies: Information may be shared as needed to enforce our agreements or to investigate violations. This might involve sharing data with legal counsel or forensic consultants.","Legal Requirements and Safety: We may disclose your information when we have a good-faith belief that such disclosure is necessary to do one or more of the following:","No Selling of Personal Data: We do not sell your personal information to third parties for profit, and we have not done so in the past. Any sharing of personal data is only done as described above.","Protect against or prevent fraud, security issues, or harm: We might share information with law enforcement or relevant institutions if we believe it’s reasonably necessary to detect or prevent illegal activities, fraud, or imminent harm to someone’s rights, property, or safety. For example, if we detect an account engaged in distributing malware or threats via Dither, we might report relevant info to authorities.","Regulatory and Compliance: If necessary, we may share information with regulatory bodies or auditors. For instance, to the extent Dither’s operations ever fall under certain financial regulations, we might need to share user transaction data with regulators like the U.S. SEC, FINRA, or analogous international bodies, but only as required by law. We may also share information to comply with anti-money laundering (AML) and similar regulations if applicable in the future, which could involve sharing data with identity verification services or government entities.","Service Providers and Partners: We employ third-party companies and individuals to help us operate and improve Dither (for example, cloud hosting providers, software development contractors, analytics providers, email service providers). These service providers may process your information on our behalf for tasks like data storage, server maintenance, email delivery, customer support, or analytics. We share with them only the information necessary for them to perform their functions, and we contractually bind them to protect your data and use it only for the purposes we specify. For instance, our hosting provider stores our databases and therefore technically has your data on its servers, but they cannot legally use it for anything except storing and retrieving it as needed to run our service. We ensure any service provider we use is required to adhere to standards at least as protective as those in this Privacy Policy.","Third-Party Integrations: Dither may integrate with third-party services (for example, a GIF image provider for adding images to chats, or a link preview service). If you choose to engage with those features, some data (like your IP address or the content of a request) might be shared with that third-party to fulfill the request (e.g., fetching a preview of a link might tell the preview service your IP and the link you are interested in). We will inform you within the app when a feature is powered by a third party, to the extent possible, so you know when another service’s privacy policy might apply.","We only share the data we must, and we carefully evaluate all requests and agreements to ensure your privacy is respected.","We understand that your personal data is important, and we are not in the business of selling it. We share information only in the following circumstances:","With Other Users or the Public: Any information you post or transact via Dither’s blockchain integration is shared with the public by design. This includes your on-chain messages and content (which are visible to anyone on the AtomOne blockchain or via Dither’s interface), your public blockchain address and Dither profile (if you have set up a profile), and any actions you take that are inherently social or public. For example, if you send a message, anyone on Dither or anyone monitoring the blockchain can see that message and the address that sent it. Similarly, if you “like” or react to content (if such a feature exists), others may see that action associated with your address or profile. We may also, as part of community engagement, repost or highlight content that you have made public (such as quoting a mention on an external social media account, or showcasing a popular public Dither thread on a blog). We will not disclose private communications with us (like support emails) publicly, except with your permission or in anonymized form.","With Your Consent: In cases other than those above, if we ever need to share your information for a new purpose, we will ask for your consent. For example, if we want to feature your testimonial or success story on our website, we would ask for your permission before using your name or content."]},{"l":"6. International Data Transfers","p":["Dither is a global service, and your information may be transferred to or stored in multiple countries, including the United States. Specifically, our company is based in the USA, and our servers and service providers may be located in the U.S. or other jurisdictions. This means that your personal data may be processed outside of your home country, and those locations may have different data protection laws than your country.","If you are located in the European Economic Area (EEA), the United Kingdom, or other regions with laws governing data collection and use that differ from U.S. law, please note that we will transfer data to the U.S. and possibly other countries. We rely on legal mechanisms to ensure adequate data protection for such international transfers. These might include:","Using contracts such as the European Commission’s Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) with our service providers to ensure that they protect EEA/UK personal data according to EU standards.","Ensuring recipients of the data are certified under frameworks like the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (once applicable/approved) or a similar arrangement, if available.","In some cases, transferring data with your explicit consent where appropriate (for example, if you explicitly request a service that necessitates the transfer of your information to a different country).","Regardless of where your data is processed, we apply the same protections described in this Policy. We also monitor developments in international data transfer law and adjust our practices to remain compliant.","By using Dither or providing us with information, you consent to the transfer of your personal information to the United States and other countries which may have different data protection rules than your country. We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy wherever it is processed.","If you have questions about our transfer mechanisms or want more information about cross-border data transfer safeguards, you can contact us (see the “Contact Us” section below)."]},{"l":"7. Data Retention","p":["We retain your personal data only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected, as described in this Privacy Policy, or as required by law. Because different types of data have different purposes, retention periods can vary:","On-Chain Data: Data written to the AtomOne blockchain (such as Dither posts, transactions, and addresses) is retained indefinitely on the public ledger by design. We do not have the ability to alter or delete blockchain history. Effectively, on-chain personal data is permanent. Consider this carefully when using Dither.","Account and Profile Data: If Dither has user accounts or profile data stored off-chain and you deactivate or delete your account, we will remove or anonymize personal data associated with your account within a reasonable timeframe, except as noted below. Some residual data (like logs associated with your user ID) might remain in backups for a short period (generally not more than 90 days) but will be deleted according to our backup retention schedule. If your account was essentially just an on-chain wallet (with minimal off-chain data), there may not be much “account” data for us to delete on our side; in such cases, deleting your account simply means you stop using Dither (the on-chain data remains on the blockchain).","Log and Analytics Data: We generally retain web server logs and anonymized analytics data for a limited period to support troubleshooting, analysis, and compliance. For example, basic logs might be kept for a few weeks or months, and aggregated analytics data might be kept longer. We aim to remove or anonymize data in a reasonable timeframe when it’s no longer needed (e.g., “rolling” deletion of logs older than a certain number of days). If data is deleted from our live systems, it may persist in secure backups until those backups are overwritten, but we will not restore personal data from backups except as needed for disaster recovery or if legally required.","Legal and Compliance: We might retain data longer if necessary to comply with legal obligations or to protect legal rights. For example, certain transaction records might be kept for a number of years to comply with financial or tax regulations, or information relevant to a dispute might be retained until that issue is resolved. We also retain data as necessary to enforce our Terms or to resolve disputes. Any such data will be maintained only as long as required for those purposes.","When we no longer have a legitimate need to retain your personal information, we will securely delete, anonymize, or isolate it, as appropriate. If you have specific questions about retention of certain data, you can contact us (see Contact section)."]},{"l":"8. Your Rights and Choices","p":["Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have certain rights regarding your personal data. We extend core privacy rights to all Dither users where feasible, and we specifically ensure compliance with rights granted under laws such as the EU/UK General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Below, we outline your rights and how you can exercise them. Please note that these rights are not absolute and may be subject to conditions or limitations under applicable law (for example, some rights do not apply to data made public by the user, like blockchain posts).","Access and Portability: You have the right to request a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to obtain information about how we process it. For blockchain data, note that it’s already publicly accessible (you can use any AtomOne block explorer to see your on-chain actions associated with your address). For off-chain data (such as any profile or account information we store, or support communications), you can request that we provide you with that information in a common electronic format. This is sometimes called the right to data portability.","Rectification (Correction): If any personal data we have is incorrect or incomplete, you have the right to ask us to correct or update it. For example, if you change your email address or if we somehow recorded your name incorrectly in our systems, let us know and we will fix it. We cannot change historical blockchain records (nothing can), but off-chain profile info or other data we maintain can be updated.","Deletion (Right to be Forgotten): You may request that we delete your personal data under certain circumstances. For example, if you no longer want to use Dither, you can ask us to delete your account and associated off-chain personal data. We will do so unless we are required to retain it (for example, for legal compliance or if the data is still necessary for the purpose it was collected). Keep in mind: we cannot delete data that is stored on the blockchain. On-chain data is beyond our control and typically cannot be removed by anyone. We will, however, remove references to on-chain content in our own systems. For example, if you request account deletion, we can stop showing your Dither messages in the Dither interface, but the raw data will remain on-chain and accessible through the blockchain.","Restriction of Processing: In certain situations, you have the right to ask us to limit how we’re using your data (for instance, to stop processing but not delete it, in cases where you need the data preserved for a legal claim or you dispute its accuracy). This right is typically applicable if you contest the accuracy of the data or if our processing is unlawful and you oppose full erasure. When processing is restricted, we can still store your data but not use it for other purposes until the restriction is lifted.","Objection to Processing: You can object to certain processing of your data if it is being done under a legal basis of legitimate interests or public interest. For example, if we were processing your data for direct marketing (which we currently do not do without your consent), you could object and opt out of that marketing. You can also object to processing for research or statistical purposes in some cases. We will honor such objections unless we have compelling legitimate grounds to continue or if the data is needed for legal claims or other overriding purposes permitted by law.","Automated Decision-Making: Dither does not use your personal data for any purely automated decisions that produce legal or similarly significant effects about you. In other words, we are not subjecting you to decisions based solely on automated processing (like algorithmic decisions without human involvement) that significantly affect your rights or interests. If that ever changes (for example, if in the future we implemented an AI-based moderation system making binding decisions on content or access), you would have rights regarding such processing, including the right to request human review of the decision. We would also update this Policy to reflect such a change.","Consent Withdrawal: If you have provided consent for any optional processing of personal data, you can withdraw that consent at any time. For instance, if you consented to receive promotional emails or newsletters, you can opt out by clicking “unsubscribe” in those emails or by contacting us to have your name removed. Withdrawal of consent will not affect the lawfulness of any processing that happened before you withdrew consent. Do note that if you withdraw consent for something necessary to provide the service (for example, if you had given consent to store your email address for login or notifications and you withdraw it), you might lose access to that feature of Dither. As an example, if you withdraw consent for us to store your email, you would not receive account recovery emails or certain alerts.","To exercise any of these rights, please contact us at legal@tendermint.com or use the contact information provided in the Contact Us section below. We may need to verify your identity before fulfilling certain requests (to ensure we don’t give your data to an impostor). We will respond to your request within a reasonable timeframe and in accordance with applicable law. (For EU/UK residents, this generally means within 1 month, extendable by an additional 2 months if necessary, in which case we will inform you of the extension.)","If you are in the EEA or UK and believe we have not complied with your data protection rights, you have the right to lodge a complaint with your local supervisory authority (for example, the Data Protection Commission in Ireland, or the ICO in the UK). We would appreciate the chance to address your concerns first, so we encourage you to contact us directly before involving regulators."]},{"l":"9. Security Measures","p":["We take security seriously and implement reasonable and appropriate measures to protect your personal data from loss, theft, misuse, and unauthorized access or disclosure. Our security program includes:","Encryption: Where applicable, we use encryption to protect data. For instance, our website and app traffic are encrypted via HTTPS (TLS) to secure data in transit between your device and our servers. Sensitive data that we might store (such as passwords, if any) are stored in hashed or encrypted form. On-chain data is by design transparent, so encryption mainly applies to data in our systems. Also, remember that your blockchain private keys are managed by you. We never ask for or hold your private keys.","Access Controls: We limit access to personal data to employees, contractors, and agents who need to know that information in order to operate, develop, or improve Dither. Those who have access are subject to strict contractual confidentiality obligations and may be disciplined or terminated if they fail to meet these obligations. Our systems enforce permissions so that, for example, support staff cannot arbitrarily access sensitive databases unless it is necessary for their job duties.","Monitoring & Testing: We regularly monitor our systems for possible vulnerabilities and attacks. We employ firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and other monitoring tools to guard against malicious activity. We also periodically test our security measures (through internal reviews and, in some cases, third-party audits or penetration tests) to ensure they remain effective and up-to-date.","Secure Development Practices: Our engineering processes follow secure coding guidelines. Changes to code are reviewed, and we keep software dependencies updated to patch known security issues promptly. We strive to build security into our platform from the ground up.","Data Minimization: We aim to collect only the data that we need. Less data retained means less risk. For example, by using Plausible Analytics, we avoid collecting personally identifiable analytics data (like long-term storage of IP addresses). We focus on aggregate data whenever possible.","Incident Response: We have an incident response plan for dealing with potential data breaches or security incidents. If a breach affecting personal data occurs, we will notify affected users and/or relevant authorities as required by law. We will also take steps to contain the breach and mitigate any harm.","However, it’s important to note that no system is 100% secure. Blockchain technology, for example, provides robust security through decentralization and cryptography, but user errors (like losing a private key or falling for phishing scams) can compromise individual accounts. We encourage you to also take steps to secure your accounts and data, such as:","Using a strong, unique password for any Dither-related accounts or your email.","Safeguarding your blockchain wallet’s private keys and recovery phrases (consider using hardware wallets for significant assets).","Being wary of phishing attempts. Remember that we will never ask you for your wallet’s private key or seed phrase.","Enabling additional security features we may offer (like two-factor authentication) when they become available.","Keeping your devices secure (updated operating system, antivirus software, and device passwords).","If you have reason to believe that your interaction with Dither is no longer secure (for example, if you suspect your account or wallet has been compromised), please immediately notify us as described in the Contact Us section below."]},{"l":"10. Children’s Privacy","p":["Dither is not intended for use by anyone under the age of 18. We do not knowingly collect personal data from children under 18 years of age. If you are under 18, please do not use Dither or provide any personal information to us.","As stated in our Terms, individuals under 18 are not permitted to use the Services. We do not knowingly allow such individuals to register or post personal data. If we discover that a person under 18 has provided us with personal information, we will take steps to delete that information promptly, except to the extent it’s on the blockchain, which we cannot erase. This is another reason minors should not use Dither, since their on-chain activity is permanent.","Parents or guardians: If you become aware that your minor child (under 18) has provided us with personal information, please contact us so that we can delete it. We may ask for proof that you are the child’s parent or guardian before honoring such a request.","Because of the nature of Dither (publishing to a public blockchain), even if we act to remove an under-18 user’s data from systems we control, some data (like messages already written to the blockchain) cannot be deleted. We will, however, do what we can, such as disabling the account, removing it from our interface, and preventing further use, to mitigate exposure. Ultimately, the permanence of blockchain records is one more reason we strongly discourage any minors from using Dither."]},{"l":"11. Regional Privacy Notices","p":["We understand that privacy laws and expectations can vary by region. Dither is committed to complying with applicable privacy regulations in all jurisdictions where we operate. Below are additional notices and clarifications for users in certain regions:","California (CCPA/CPRA): If you are a California resident, you have specific privacy rights under the California Consumer Privacy Act (as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act). These include the right to know what personal information we collect, the right to request deletion of your personal information, the right to request correction of inaccurate personal information, and the right to opt out of the “sale” or “sharing” of your personal information. We want to clarify that, as described in this Policy, we do not sell or share your personal information as those terms are defined in California law. Because we do not monetize your data in that way, the opt-out right is not applicable. You also have the right not to receive discriminatory treatment for exercising your privacy rights. The rights to access, delete, and correct information can be exercised as described in Section 8 above (Your Rights and Choices). If you have any questions about how California privacy law applies to Dither, feel free to contact us.","EEA and UK (GDPR): If you are in the European Economic Area or the United Kingdom, we process your personal data in accordance with the EU and UK General Data Protection Regulation. That means we ensure you can exercise all the rights outlined in Section 8 above. We have also described our data practices, such as the purposes of processing and the categories of data, in line with GDPR requirements. For individuals in these regions, the legal bases for our processing include: (1) Contractual necessity, as we process data to provide you with the Dither service you requested (for example, processing your on-chain posts as part of the service); (2) Legitimate interests, such as maintaining the security of the platform and improving our services (we only rely on legitimate interests where we believe our use of data is not overridden by your privacy rights); and (3) Compliance with legal obligations, where we process and retain data as needed to comply with laws. We do not use your personal data for any purpose that would require consent under the GDPR without obtaining your consent (for instance, we currently do not use your data for direct marketing or automated profiling without consent). If you believe your privacy rights under GDPR have been infringed, you have the right to lodge a complaint with your local Data Protection Authority, as noted above. However, we hope to resolve any issues directly if you contact us first.","Other Regions: No matter where you are located, we aim to respect your privacy and comply with applicable laws. If your country or region grants you additional privacy rights beyond those described here, we will honor those rights to the extent required by law. All In Bits, Inc. is the operator of Dither globally, and there are no separate local operating entities. This Privacy Policy is intended to be a comprehensive statement of our practices for users worldwide. Nothing in this Policy is intended to limit any rights or protections you may have under the laws of your jurisdiction. If you have questions about how we handle data in your region, you can always reach out to us for clarification."]},{"l":"12. Changes to this Privacy Policy","p":["We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices, technologies, legal requirements, or for other reasons. When we make changes, we will:","Post the updated Privacy Policy on our website (and in the app, if applicable) with a new “Last Updated” date.","Notify you of significant changes. If the changes are material, we will provide a more prominent notice (such as a banner on the site, an in-app alert, or an email notification) explaining the updates. For example, if we change the types of data we collect or how we use it in a significant way, you’ll be informed and may be prompted to review the new terms.","If required by law, we may also seek your consent for certain changes (for instance, if a new use of data is materially different and legal standards require obtaining consent).","We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically to stay informed about our data practices and any updates. Your continued use of Dither after any changes to this Policy constitutes your acceptance of the updated terms (to the extent permitted by law). If you do not agree with any changes, you should stop using Dither and can request that we delete your data as outlined in Section 8.","For historical reference, we may keep prior versions of this Privacy Policy accessible or available upon request so you can see how our practices have evolved."]},{"l":"13. Contact Us","p":["If you have any questions, concerns, or requests regarding this Privacy Policy or our data practices, you can reach out to us:","By Email: You can email our legal/privacy team at legal@tendermint.com. (This is our designated address for privacy inquiries and official communications.)","By Mail: All In Bits, Inc., Attn: Privacy Officer, 3395 South Jones Blvd. #153, Las Vegas, NV 89146, USA.","By Phone: You may contact our designated agent (Carolyn Pehrson, at the phone number provided in our DMCA section) for urgent matters. However, for tracking and efficiency, email is preferred for most requests.","We will do our best to respond promptly to your inquiry. For certain requests (such as exercising your data rights), please allow us time to verify your identity and gather information. We will respond within the timeframe required by law (if applicable, e.g., within 30 days for many jurisdictions, or we will explain any necessary delay).","If you contact us to exercise a privacy right, please clearly state what you need (for example, “I’d like a copy of my personal data,” or “Please delete my account data”). We may ask for additional information to verify your identity or to clarify the scope of your request, and we will then proceed in accordance with applicable law.","Thank you for reading our Privacy Policy. We care about protecting your personal data while providing a platform for free and secure communication. Your trust is important to us, and we’re continuously working to maintain and improve the privacy and security of Dither."]}],[{"l":"Dither Terms and Conditions","p":["30-Day Right to Opt Out: As noted, if you are a new user of Dither, you may opt out of the Arbitration Agreement and Class Action Waiver within 30 days of accepting these Terms, by sending a written (email is acceptable) notice to us. The notice must clearly indicate your intent to opt out of arbitration. If you opt out, then notwithstanding the opt-out, these Terms will continue to apply to you, and the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the Delaware courts will govern any litigation that arises between you and All in Bits (with the jury trial waiver and class waiver still applicable). If you do not opt out within the 30-day period, you will be bound by the arbitration agreement and class action waiver as described above.","A statement that the information in your notice is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that you are the copyright owner or authorized to act on the copyright owner’s behalf.","A statement that you have a good-faith belief that the disputed use of the material is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law (for example, “I believe in good faith that the use of the copyrighted material described above is not authorized by the owner, its agent, or the law”).","Acceptance of Terms","AI training. We do not use your posts to train generative AI systems. If that changes, we will update these Terms and provide notice.","All in Bits may, from time to time, modify or update these Terms. We may do so for various reasons, such as to reflect changes in Dither’s features or functionality, to account for updates to laws or regulations, or to clarify our policies. We will notify users of material changes by posting the updated Terms on the Dither website or app and updating the “Effective Date” at the top, and/or by providing a notice through Dither or via email (if we have your contact information). It is your responsibility to review these Terms periodically. Updated Terms will be effective as of the time of posting (or a later date if specified in the update). By continuing to use Dither after any changes to the Terms take effect, you agree to the revised Terms. If you do not agree to the revised Terms, you must stop using Dither and, if applicable, disconnect your wallet from the platform.","All in Bits reserves the right, at our own expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise subject to indemnification by you (in which case you agree to cooperate with us in defending such matter and not to settle any such matter without our consent). You agree to promptly notify All in Bits of any third-party claims against you that could affect All in Bits, of which you become aware. This indemnity obligation will survive any termination of your use of Dither or these Terms.","All in Bits respects intellectual property rights and expects users to do the same. Although content on Dither is stored on a blockchain, we are committed to complying with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (“DMCA”) and other applicable copyright laws. If you believe that any content on Dither infringes your copyright (for example, someone has posted your copyrighted work without permission), you or your agent may send us a DMCA Notice of Alleged Infringement. Upon our receipt of a valid DMCA notice, we will review the claim and take appropriate action, which may include removing or disabling access to the allegedly infringing content on any Dither interface we control and/or notifying the user who posted it. Due to Dither’s decentralized design, removal from our interface does not guarantee complete removal from the blockchain, but we will make a good-faith effort to limit access via our services.","All in Bits will, in appropriate circumstances, terminate users who are repeat infringers. Because Dither is tied to wallet addresses, this may involve banning the offending wallet address from interacting with our services. We also reserve the right to restrict access by any user who we believe is infringing intellectual property rights, at our discretion.","All in Bits, Inc. is the entity responsible for Dither. All official notices or legal communications should be directed to our designated agent as listed above in the DMCA section (Carolyn Pehrson, at the address provided) or via email to legal@tendermint.com. For general questions or support regarding Dither or these Terms, you may contact us by email at legal@tendermint.com.","Arbitration Agreement: You and All in Bits agree that any dispute, claim, or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the Dither platform (including its interpretation or the breach, termination, or validity thereof), or the use of the Service, shall be resolved exclusively through final and binding arbitration, rather than in court, except as otherwise stated in the “Exceptions” subsection below. This arbitration agreement is governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. §§ 1 et seq.) and evidences a transaction in interstate commerce. This provision shall survive termination of the agreement.","Arbitration and Legal Costs: Each party will be responsible for its own attorneys’ fees and costs in arbitration, unless the arbitrator determines that a claim was frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (in which case the arbitrator may award attorneys’ fees to the prevailing party, to the extent permitted by law). The payment of JAMS fees and costs will be governed by the JAMS rules; however, if you are an individual consumer and not able to pay the filing fee, All in Bits will consider a request to pay or reimburse fees to ensure the arbitration proceeds.","Arbitration Procedures: The arbitration will be administered by JAMS (Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services) or a similar reputable arbitration body, under the JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules & Procedures, including any expedited procedures where applicable. The JAMS rules are available at the JAMS website ( https://www.jamsadr.com). If JAMS is not available to arbitrate, the parties will select an alternative arbitral forum by mutual agreement. The arbitration will be conducted by a single, neutral arbitrator. The language of the arbitration shall be English. The seat or legal place of arbitration will be Wilmington, Delaware, USA, but (unless the parties agree otherwise) the arbitration may be conducted remotely via video conference or telephone to make it more convenient for both parties. Confidentiality: Both you and All in Bits agree that any arbitration proceedings (and any rulings, decisions or awards by the arbitrator) will be kept confidential, except as may be necessary to prepare for or conduct the arbitration, or to enforce the arbitration award in court.","Assignment: You may not assign or transfer these Terms (or any of your rights or obligations hereunder) without our prior written consent. Any attempted assignment by you in violation of this provision is null and void. All in Bits may freely assign or transfer these Terms to an affiliate or in connection with a merger, acquisition, corporate reorganization, or sale of all or substantially all of our assets.","Automated Access / Scraping Controls: You may not bypass or defeat rate limits, engage in bulk scraping or automated posting outside documented APIs, or otherwise degrade or disrupt the Service. We may block abusive IPs, clients, or keys.","Blockchain Risks: Dither operates on a blockchain network, which means transactions (including posting content) are processed by a decentralized network of computers. All in Bits has no control over the blockchain transactions or fees required (such as gas fees). You understand that blockchain technology comes with inherent risks, including the possibility of software bugs, network failures, consensus failures, unexpected chain forks, or other technical issues that could affect the platform’s operation. You also understand that transactions on the blockchain are irreversible; if you accidentally post something or send a transaction with errors, we cannot undo it. All in Bits is not responsible for any losses or consequences arising from blockchain operational issues, such as delayed or failed transactions, smart contract vulnerabilities, or incompatibility with your device or wallet.","By posting content on Dither, you affirm that you have the rights to any material you upload (e.g., you wrote the text, or have permission to post it), and you understand that this content will be broadly and permanently disseminated. You retain ownership of the intellectual property in content you create, but you grant All in Bits and other Dither users a license to store, transmit, display, and reproduce your content as necessary for operating the platform. This license is worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, and sublicensable (for example, it allows other users to view your posts and allows third-party services to retrieve and display them). Because the content is published on a public blockchain, you also effectively allow the public at large to access and read your posts. Do not post any content on Dither that you wish to keep private or that you do not have the legal right to share in a public, permanent manner.","By submitting content, you also agree that you have all necessary rights to that content and that no content you post will infringe or violate the rights of any third party (including intellectual property rights, privacy rights, or contractual rights). You are solely responsible for the content you post. If your content includes any third-party material (for example, excerpts of text, images, or videos you did not create), it is your responsibility to ensure you have permission or a legal basis to include it. All in Bits does not pre-approve content, and we do not assume liability for user posts; however, if we are notified of infringing content, we will respond as described below.","By using Dither, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agreed to these Terms and Conditions. Thank you for being part of the Dither community and helping us build a decentralized platform grounded in transparency, freedom, and responsibility.","Changes to the Terms","Chronological Feed (No Algorithmic Ranking): Content on Dither is displayed in strict chronological order, from newest to oldest. We do not use any algorithmic ranking or personalized feed sorting to prioritize certain posts over others.","Class Action Waiver: You and All in Bits each agree that any disputes will be resolved only on an individual basis, and not in a class, consolidated, or representative action. This means that you waive your right to participate in any class action lawsuit, class-wide arbitration, or other representative proceeding against us. The arbitrator may not consolidate or join the claims of other persons or parties who may be similarly situated, and shall not have authority to hear arbitration as a class action. If this class action waiver is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of the Arbitration Agreement (above) shall be null and void, but the remainder of the Terms will continue to apply.","Community Guidelines and Prohibited Content","Community-Driven Moderation: Dither’s moderation model is primarily conscience-driven and community-led. This means we encourage users to self-moderate and to use the tools provided (such as content filters, muting or blocking users, and community flagging mechanisms) to curate their own experience. Unlike traditional social media, there is no algorithmic content removal or ranking done behind the scenes by the Company. Instead, visibility of content is organic, every post is out there on the blockchain, and you choose whom to follow or what content to see, possibly with help from community-provided filters.","Compliance and Eligibility: By using Dither, you also represent that you are not prohibited from using the service under applicable laws (for example, you are not on any trade sanctions or prohibited persons lists), and that you will comply with all relevant laws and regulations while using Dither. We reserve the right to refuse access to Dither, or to suspend/terminate any user’s access, if we determine you have violated these Terms or if we are required to do so by law.","Contact Information","Coordinated Disinformation: While Dither does not employ algorithmic censorship, we do not allow coordinated disinformation campaigns on the platform. In other words, you may not use Dither to deliberately spread false or misleading information at scale, especially if done in an organized or automated fashion to deceive the community or manipulate public opinion. This includes creating bots or multiple accounts working together to amplify propaganda or fake news. Our community values truthful, authentic dialogue, and maliciously undermining that with disinformation is against these Terms. This guideline is not intended to police ordinary sharing of opinions or unintentional misinformation by individuals; it targets deliberate, coordinated attempts to deceive.","Copyright Infringement Policy (DMCA Notice)","Counter-Notification: If you are a user who posted content that was removed due to a DMCA notice, and you believe the content was mistakenly removed (for example, as a result of misidentification or because you believe you have the right to post it), you may send us a counter-notification. A valid counter-notification should include your contact information, identification of the content removed, a statement under penalty of perjury that you have a good-faith belief the content was removed in error or misidentification, and your consent to the jurisdiction of the federal court in your district (or in Nevada, if you are outside the United States). Upon receiving a valid counter-notice, we may restore the content in question after at least 10 business days unless our designated agent first receives notice that the original complaining party has filed a court action seeking to restrain you from infringing the material. (Please consult legal counsel or see 17 U.S.C. §512(g) for the requirements of a proper DMCA counter-notification.)","Decentralized Platform Features and User Content","Designated Copyright Agent: In accordance with the DMCA, All in Bits has designated the following agent to receive notifications of claimed infringement.

As such, its core features and behaviors may differ from traditional social networks. By using Dither, you understand and agree to the following characteristics of the platform:","Dither is an experimental, cutting-edge platform, and we want to be upfront that your use of Dither is at your own risk. All in Bits provides the Dither service on an “AS IS” and “AS AVAILABLE” basis, without any warranties of any kind, either express or implied. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we disclaim all warranties and conditions, express or implied, regarding Dither and its content, including (but not limited to) implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, non-infringement, accuracy, and quiet enjoyment. We do not guarantee that the platform will meet your requirements or expectations, that it will be uninterrupted, secure, or error-free, or that any content (including user content) will be accurate or reliable.","Dither is founded on principles of free expression and community self-moderation. We believe in giving users control over their social experience without centralized curation. However, freedom comes with responsibility: to keep Dither a welcoming and lawful space, we have community guidelines that all users must follow. By contributing content to Dither or interacting with others, you agree to abide by these guidelines and not engage in prohibited conduct. In general, use common sense and be respectful. You are expected to moderate your own behavior conscientiously and help maintain a healthy community. If you violate these rules, you risk community backlash and potential action on our part (including suspension or banning of your wallet from posting, as described later). Prohibited content or activities on Dither include, but are not limited to, the following:","Doxing and Privacy Violations: Do not post other people’s personal or sensitive information without consent. This includes personal data such as someone’s full name, home address, telephone number, email address, Social Security or other government ID numbers, financial information, or any information that is not publicly available and could violate someone’s privacy. Publishing private communications of someone without permission is strictly prohibited. Respect others’ privacy just as you would want yours to be respected.","Effective Date: September 25, 2025","Eligibility and Account Requirements","Entire Agreement: These Terms (including any policies or guidelines incorporated by reference) constitute the entire agreement between you and All in Bits concerning your use of Dither, and supersede any prior agreements, proposals or communications (whether oral or written) relating to your use of the platform.","Exceptions to Arbitration: Notwithstanding the above, both parties retain the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction (which for All in Bits means the state or federal courts in Delaware, unless another jurisdiction is required by law) to prevent actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of a party’s copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property rights. In addition, if you are an individual (i.e., not a business) using Dither for personal use, you have the right to opt out of this arbitration agreement within 30 days of first agreeing to these Terms by sending written notice of your decision to opt out to legal@tendermint.com, including your name and wallet address. If you opt out of arbitration, you agree that all disputes (subject to the class action waiver and jury waiver above) must be resolved exclusively in the courts specified above.","Feature Development: Dither is a novel platform that may introduce new features or change existing ones over time as it evolves. Beta features or updates may be deployed which could have unforeseen issues. We make no guarantees regarding the availability or functionality of any specific feature. For example, a feature such as content filtering or upvote/downvote tracking might be modified, or new moderation tools might be added, in the future. We will try to communicate significant changes, but such changes may not come with prior notice. You accept the risk that the service may change and that any part of the service may be modified, suspended, or discontinued at any time without liability.","Feedback: If you choose to provide us with feedback or suggestions about Dither (for example, ideas to improve features or reports of bugs), you acknowledge that we may use or implement those suggestions without any compensation or obligation to you. Any feedback you provide is entirely voluntary, and we will be free to use it as we see fit and without restriction.","For any minor or non-material changes (such as rephrasing or corrections), we may not provide advance notice, so it’s wise to check this document occasionally. For significant changes (like changes to the dispute resolution clause or new user obligations), we will aim to give advance notice when possible. Regardless, we encourage you to stay informed about our Terms to ensure you understand the conditions of using Dither.","Force Majeure: All in Bits shall not be liable for any delay or failure to perform resulting from causes outside its reasonable control, such as natural disasters, acts of government, war, civil unrest, acts of terror, labor strikes, internet or power outages, or other force majeure events.","Governing Law and Dispute Resolution","Governing Law: These Terms and any dispute or claim arising out of or related to these Terms or your use of Dither shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, USA, without regard to its conflict of law principles. However, if you reside outside the United States, you may have certain consumer protection rights under the laws of your country of residence that are in addition to or different from the protections under Delaware law; these Terms are not intended to deprive you of those protections to the extent they apply by law.","Harassment and Hate: Dither prohibits content that harasses, bullies, or threatens others. You may not post anything that promotes violence or hatred against individuals or groups based on characteristics such as race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sex, gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, or medical condition. Personal attacks, stalking, and encouragement of self-harm or suicide are also forbidden. We strive for a community where users feel safe and respected; engaging in persistent harassment or hate speech will not be tolerated.","Headings: The section titles in these Terms are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect.","Identification of the copyrighted work you believe has been infringed. If multiple copyrighted works are covered by your notice (e.g., a list of images), you may provide a representative list.","Identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing and that you request to be removed or disabled, including information reasonably sufficient to allow us to locate the material. Be as specific as possible, ideally including the URL or transaction hash or post ID on Dither where the material appears.","If your notice does not contain all of these elements, it may not be effective under the DMCA. Once we receive a compliant notice, we will act expeditiously to investigate and address the issue. We may forward the notice (with your contact information) to the user who posted the content, and/or publicly post the notice (with personal information redacted) to a database of takedown requests.","Illegal Content; Mandatory Reporting (CSAM/NCMEC): We strictly prohibit child sexual exploitation material (CSAM) and related offenses. If we become aware of suspected CSAM, we will report to the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children (NCMEC) and preserve and disclose information as required by 18 U.S.C. §2258A and other applicable laws.","Illegal Material or Activities: Do not use Dither for any unlawful purposes or to post any content that is illegal under applicable laws. This includes (but is not limited to) content related to child sexual exploitation, human trafficking, illicit drug sales, explicit incitement of violence or criminal activity, or any material that would violate laws or regulations if distributed. You also may not use Dither in violation of export control or sanctions laws (for example, by providing services to users in prohibited regions).","Imminent Harm: Where we reasonably believe content or activity poses an imminent risk of serious harm, we may immediately restrict access to that content on interfaces we control, notify appropriate authorities, and take other proportionate steps.","Immutable and Convergent Content: Because of the blockchain-backed design, the “state” of Dither (all the posts and interactions) can be reproduced by any client that reads the blockchain data. This means third-party applications can also display Dither content by accessing the same public data. You acknowledge that multiple interfaces or apps may access and present Dither posts, and All in Bits does not exclusively control how content is displayed across all platforms. (For example, an independent developer could create their own app or website to read Dither’s blockchain data and show posts in their own style or with additional features.)","In addition, All in Bits’ total aggregate liability to you for all claims arising out of or relating to these Terms or the Dither service will not exceed the greater of: (a) One Hundred U.S. Dollars (US $100.00), or (b) the total amount you have paid to All in Bits for use of Dither in the twelve months prior to the claim (which, in most cases, will be $0, since Dither generally does not charge for basic usage). This limitation applies to any and all claims, whether based on warranty, contract, statute, tort (including negligence), or any other legal theory.","Indemnification","Independent Interfaces and Moderators: Third‑party interfaces that read Dither’s on‑chain data, and community moderators who operate them, are independent of All in Bits and are not our agents. We are not responsible for decisions or policies adopted by independent interfaces or moderators.","Intellectual Property Infringement: Only post content that you have rights to post. Do not share content that violates the copyright, trademark, or other intellectual property rights of others. For example, do not upload someone else’s artwork, music, or text without permission, and do not use Dither to distribute pirated material. If you incorporate any third-party content in your posts, you must have the legal right to do so (such as a license or fair use rationale). If you repeatedly infringe on others’ intellectual property rights, we may suspend or terminate your access, and infringing content may be removed in accordance with our Copyright policy (see “DMCA” below).","Interface Providers and Community Filters: Because Dither content is open and accessible, various “interface providers” (including the official Dither app/website and third-party apps) may offer their own moderation features. For example, a particular Dither interface might allow users to mark posts as sensitive or hide posts that the community has broadly flagged for containing certain types of content. Interface providers may filter or flag content based on community input or their own policies, to help users navigate content (e.g., hiding posts tagged as pornographic or clearly offensive), but importantly, these measures do not remove the content from the blockchain itself. They only affect how content is presented in that specific application. All in Bits is not responsible for moderation decisions made by independent third-party interfaces, which may have their own terms of service and community standards. We encourage all interface providers to honor Dither’s community guidelines, but ultimately each provider might implement filters differently.","Jury Trial Waiver: If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than through arbitration, you and All in Bits waive any right to a jury trial. You agree that if litigation does occur, any such proceeding (other than small claims, as noted in “Exceptions” below) shall be conducted exclusively in the state or federal courts located in Wilmington, Delaware, and you hereby consent to personal jurisdiction and venue in those courts. You further agree not to raise forum non conveniens or any similar objection, and that Delaware is an appropriate and convenient forum for resolving disputes.","Limitation of Liability","Mailing Address for All in Bits, Inc.: 3395 South Jones Blvd. #153, Las Vegas, NV 89146, USA. Email: legal@tendermint.com","Malicious Software and Fraud: You may not upload or link to viruses, malware, spyware, phishing schemes, or any other content that is designed to harm or exploit others’ devices or accounts. Additionally, attempts to scam or defraud users (for example, posting fraudulent investment schemes, impersonating someone in an attempt to steal assets, or directing users to malicious websites) are forbidden. Do not use Dither to engage in any form of phishing, pyramid schemes, or multi-level marketing solicitations.","Minimum Age: You must be at least 18 years old (or the age of majority in your jurisdiction, if higher) to use Dither. By using the platform, you represent and warrant that you meet this age requirement and have the legal capacity to enter into this agreement.","Miscellaneous Provisions","Moderation and Enforcement","No Advice: No information obtained through Dither constitutes professional, legal, financial or investment advice on our part. For example, even if Dither content may include discussions about cryptocurrency or tokens, All in Bits does not endorse or recommend any particular transactions. Always do your own research or consult professionals for advice as needed. You acknowledge that any decisions you make based on content on Dither are solely your own responsibility.","No Centralized Censorship (With Limited Exceptions): All in Bits will not routinely pre-screen or remove user content from the AtomOne blockchain, nor do we dictate what should be visible beyond providing the above guidelines. We believe in censorship-resistance and user empowerment. We do not actively moderate on-chain messages for legality or accuracy (we technically can’t), but users must abide by the law and refrain from posting prohibited material. This means any opinions, information, or materials you share are your sole responsibility. All In Bits (Dither’s parent company) disclaims liability for content posted by users to the extent allowed by law. However, we do not permit illegal content and will comply with lawful orders. We reserve the right to intervene and enforce these Terms when necessary. In particular, if we become aware of content that flagrantly violates these Terms or the law (for example, illegal content such as child exploitation material, credible threats of violence, or similarly extreme situations), we may act to remove, block, or restrict that content on any official Dither interfaces we control, and/or prevent the offending user (wallet address) from further participation on those interfaces. We may also refer matters to law enforcement when appropriate. Such actions are taken at our sole discretion and may occur with or without prior notice to the user, especially if urgent. It’s important to understand that even if we block content on our own interface or ban a user’s wallet from posting via our service, the content might still exist on the underlying blockchain or be accessible through other means. Our actions are limited to what we control (for instance, the Dither web application or any nodes we operate). We cannot guarantee the complete elimination of any content from the decentralized network.","No Control Over User Behavior: You understand that other users contribute content to Dither, and we do not approve content before it is published. We do not endorse, guarantee, or make any representations regarding any user-generated content on Dither. Content may be offensive, inaccurate, or misleading, and in some cases may be mislabeled or deceptively posted. All in Bits is not liable for any statements or conduct of any third parties on Dither. Use your judgment and be cautious about the content you read or the people you interact with on the platform.","No Delivery Guarantee: Interface display and delivery are best‑effort. We do not guarantee that any post or action will be displayed, propagated, or delivered within any particular time.","No Duty to Monitor; Good‑Faith Moderation: We are not obligated to screen, monitor, review, or edit user content. We may, however, in our sole discretion and in good faith, remove, refuse to display, label, filter, limit visibility of, or disable access to any content on interfaces we control, at any time and for any reason (including to comply with law, enforce these Terms, or reduce potential liability), without affecting the underlying blockchain record.","No Guarantee of Removal: Given the permanent, decentralized nature of Dither, removal of content (even if it violates these Terms) may not be absolute. While the Company or certain interface providers might block or hide content from view on specific applications, the data may still exist on the underlying blockchain or on other interfaces outside of our control. In using Dither, you accept that content you encounter is user-generated and not pre-screened by us, and you may be exposed to material that is offensive, inaccurate, or otherwise objectionable. We are not responsible for content that appears on the blockchain, but we do expect all users to adhere to the community guidelines below to foster a healthy environment.","No Personal Data Collection: Except for your public wallet address and information you choose to share on the platform, Dither does not require you to provide personal identifying information. We do not collect full names, emails, or other personal data as a condition of use. Please note, however, that content you post might contain personal information if you include it, and such content will become public on the blockchain. Refer to our Privacy Policy for details on data practices.","No Waiver: If we do not enforce any part of these Terms, it will not be considered a waiver of our rights or provisions of the Terms. Similarly, no waiver by us of any breach or default by you shall be deemed a waiver of any preceding or subsequent breach or default. All in Bits’ rights and remedies under these Terms remain cumulative and not exclusive of any other rights or remedies provided by law.","Notice and Appeal. If you believe content available through an interface we operate is illegal, or that we have restricted your content in error, contact legal@tendermint.com with details sufficient to identify the content and your reason. We will review reasonable notices and appeals and, where appropriate on interfaces we control, act and reply in a timely manner. This process concerns interface‑level measures only and does not alter on‑chain records.","Our Property: All in Bits, Inc. (and its affiliates and licensors) owns all rights, title, and interest in and to the Dither platform, including the software, the design, functionality, and all trademarks, logos, and brand features associated with Dither. All in Bits also owns the compilation of content that is presented in the Dither interface (excluding individual user posts). These are protected by intellectual property laws. You may not copy, distribute, sell, lease, reverse engineer, or otherwise exploit any part of Dither’s software or services that are owned by us, except as permitted by law or with our express written permission. This includes our website’s look-and-feel, the Dither name and logo, and any content that All in Bits or our partners have provided (unless such content is expressly noted as open source or in the public domain). You also may not use All in Bits’ trademarks (including “Dither”) in a way that could cause confusion as to source or endorsement without our prior consent.","Ownership and Intellectual Property","Please read this section carefully, as it requires you to arbitrate disputes with All in Bits and limits the manner in which you can seek relief. This means you are waiving your right to a trial by jury and to participate in class actions, as explained below.","Prompt Action on Reports. For interfaces we control, we review reports about unlawful content and abusive behavior and take appropriate action in a timely manner, consistent with our policies and applicable app‑store rules.","Public, Permanent Ledger: When you publish a post or any content on Dither, it is recorded on the AtomOne blockchain (using ChronoState event-sourcing technology) as part of a permanent, public ledger. This means that all posts are public and permanent: they are visible to anyone with access to the blockchain and cannot be easily edited or deleted once submitted. All in Bits does not have the ability to retroactively erase or modify content stored on the blockchain, since the network is decentralized and uncensorable by design. Think carefully before you post any content, because it will become a lasting part of the public record.","Regional Compliance (EU/UK and Other Jurisdictions): Where required by local law (for example, the EU Digital Services Act or the UK Online Safety Act), we may provide region‑specific notice‑and‑action mechanisms, appeals, or transparency reporting; appoint local points of contact; and limit features or access (including geo-blocking) to remain compliant.","Relationship of Parties: These Terms do not create any agency, partnership, joint venture, employment, or franchise relationship between you and All in Bits. You and we are independent contractors. You have no authority to bind us or to act on our behalf, and vice versa.","Reporting Problems: If you encounter content or behavior that you believe violates these Terms or is otherwise harmful, we encourage you to report it to us (if using an official Dither interface with a “Report” function), via email to legal@tendermint.com or to community moderators if available. We will review reports and determine the appropriate enforcement action. Please note that not all reported content will result in removal; we will balance enforcement with our commitment to open dialogue. False or malicious reporting of innocent content is itself a violation of these Terms.","Security and Software: While we strive to maintain a secure service, we do not warrant that Dither will be secure or free from viruses, malware, or other harmful components. Downloading or obtaining any material through Dither is done at your own discretion and risk. You are solely responsible for any damage to your computer system, mobile device, or wallet, or loss of data that may result from any content or material obtained through the use of Dither. We encourage you to use up-to-date antivirus software and to take other appropriate precautions.","Severability of Dispute Provisions: If any portion of this Dispute Resolution section is found to be illegal or unenforceable (other than the class action waiver, which is addressed above), such provision shall be severed and the remainder of this section shall be given full effect.","Severability: If any provision of these Terms is held by a court or arbitrator of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable, the parties nevertheless agree that the court/arbitrator should endeavor to give effect to the parties’ intentions as reflected in the provision, and the invalid or unenforceable provision will be modified to the minimum extent necessary to make it valid and enforceable, or if it cannot be made enforceable, then severed (removed) from these Terms. In either case, the remaining provisions of these Terms will continue in full force and effect.","Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain warranties. To the extent that such laws apply to you, some of the exclusions above may not apply. In that case, our warranties are limited to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law.","Spam and Network Abuse: You may not use Dither to spam or to engage in activity that could degrade the experience of others. This includes posting repetitive or irrelevant content in a way that overwhelms the platform, using scripts or automation to post or message at a rapid rate, or attempting to “trend” content by gaming the system. Also, do not attempt to overload, flood, or strain the Dither network or the underlying blockchain with unreasonable data or requests. Such behaviors can threaten platform stability and are not allowed.","Specific Acknowledgments: By using Dither, you acknowledge and agree to the following without limiting the generality of the above disclaimer:","Survival: Provisions of these Terms which by their nature should survive termination (including, by way of example, disclaimers of warranty, limitation of liability, indemnification, and dispute resolution provisions) will survive any termination or expiration of these Terms and/or your use of Dither.","The limitations of liability in this section are a fundamental part of this agreement between you and All in Bits. All in Bits would not be able to offer Dither to you on an economically feasible basis without such limitations. If applicable law does not allow the limitation of liability for certain damages (for example, in some jurisdictions certain warranties or liabilities cannot be excluded or limited), then our liability will be limited to the maximum extent permitted by law. Nothing in these Terms is intended to exclude or limit any condition, warranty, right or liability which may not be lawfully excluded or limited.","These Terms and Conditions (the “Terms”) are a binding legal agreement between you (referred to as “you” or “User”) and All in Bits, Inc. (the company that operates Dither, referred to as “All in Bits,” “the Company,” “we,” or “us”). By accessing or using Dither, you confirm that you are at least 18 years old and agree to be bound by these Terms and all applicable laws and regulations. If you do not agree with these Terms, you must not use Dither. Please read these Terms carefully, as they contain important information about your rights, obligations, and restrictions (including provisions regarding acceptable use of the service, content ownership, warranty disclaimers, limitation of liability, and requirements to resolve disputes through arbitration). These Terms incorporate by reference any additional guidelines, policies, or rules provided on the Dither website or application (including our Privacy Policy).","Third-Party Links and Services: Content on Dither or user posts may contain links to third-party websites or services that are not owned or controlled by All in Bits. Additionally, as noted, third-party apps may interface with Dither’s data. We do not endorse or assume any responsibility for any such third-party sites, information, materials, products, or services. If you access any third-party website or service via Dither, you do so at your own risk, and you understand that these Terms and our policies do not apply to those external sites. Be aware when you leave Dither and read the terms and privacy policy of any third-party service you visit.","This list of prohibited conduct is not exhaustive. All in Bits reserves the right to determine, in its reasonable discretion, whether any content or behavior is objectionable or violates the spirit of these guidelines, and to take appropriate action as described below.","To the fullest extent permitted by law, neither All in Bits nor you (the user) will be liable to the other for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages whatsoever arising out of or related to your use of (or inability to use) Dither, or any content on Dither, even if advised of the possibility of such damages. This exclusion includes, without limitation, damages for lost profits, lost data, business interruption, reputation or goodwill loss, or the cost of procurement of substitute services or technology.","Transparency: We may publish periodic transparency reports describing our moderation tools, policies, and aggregated enforcement metrics, and we may provide additional disclosures where required by law.","U.S. Legal Notice (47 U.S.C. §230): To the extent U.S. law applies, we may in good faith restrict access to material we consider objectionable, and we are not liable for third‑party content posted by users.","User Content Is Not Ours: Posts are authored by users. We do not control, endorse, or assume responsibility for user content, and we make no warranties regarding its accuracy, quality, legality, or safety. Your interactions with other users are solely between you and them.","User Disputes; Release: If you have a dispute with one or more users, you release All in Bits, Inc. (and our officers, directors, employees, contractors, and agents) from claims, demands, and damages of every kind and nature, known and unknown, arising out of or in any way connected with such disputes.","User Responsibility: Remember, you are responsible for your own conduct and content on Dither. The community will often be the judge of what is acceptable through their reactions, and any content you post is tied to your wallet address and reputation. These Terms exist to set baseline rules and protect users, but they are also aligned with values of transparency and accountability. In summary, treat others with respect, abide by the law, and think before you post. If you violate these Terms, you may lose the privilege of using Dither’s official services, and your content may be filtered or labeled, but the consequences (social or legal) of what you publish are ultimately yours to bear.","Wallet Authentication: To post content or interact on Dither, you are required to connect a supported cryptocurrency wallet. Account creation on Dither does not involve traditional usernames or passwords; instead, your blockchain wallet serves as your identity and login mechanism. You are responsible for maintaining the security of your wallet’s private keys and credentials. Do not share your private keys with anyone. We will never ask you for your private key, and you should never provide it to any third party claiming to represent Dither. All in Bits has no access to or control over your wallet or its keys, and we cannot recover your wallet or posts if you lose access to it. Any actions taken through your wallet (such as posting content or executing transactions) will be deemed to be authorized by you. If you discover any unauthorized use of your wallet or suspect that your security has been compromised, you should discontinue using Dither and notify us immediately.","When contacting us, please include your name and a detailed description of your inquiry or issue. Do not send sensitive information via email, as email may not be secure.","You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless All in Bits, Inc., its parent, affiliates, and their respective officers, directors, employees, and agents (collectively, the “Indemnified Parties”), from and against any and all claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs) that arise from or relate to your use or misuse of Dither, your violation of these Terms, or your violation of any laws or rights of a third party. This includes, for example, claims related to content you posted (such as someone else claiming that your post infringed their rights or caused them harm).","Your contact information– including your full name, mailing address, telephone number, and email address, so we can reach you if needed.","Your electronic or physical signature. If you are sending an email, you may type your full legal name as your signature. If you are sending a paper notice, you must sign it.","Your Property: You retain ownership of the content that you create and post on Dither. Posting content to Dither does not transfer ownership of any intellectual property rights you have in your content to us. However, by using Dither and posting content to the blockchain through our platform, you hereby grant us, and anyone accessing Dither, a license to use that content as needed to operate and provide the services. Specifically, you grant All in Bits a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, irrevocable license (with the right to sublicense to others, such as to users and third-party developers) to store, transmit, publish, display, and perform your content in connection with the Dither platform. This license is necessary because, for example, we need to transmit your posts to other users’ devices, display them on various interfaces, and archive them as part of the blockchain’s permanent ledger. This license continues indefinitely with respect to content recorded on the blockchain (since we cannot undo the posting), but it will cease with respect to All in Bits specifically if we delete the content from any services under our control. Even if All in Bits’ license ends, the content itself may persist on the blockchain or in decentralized storage, and other users or nodes may continue to have access to it under the decentralized network’s rules."]}]]
